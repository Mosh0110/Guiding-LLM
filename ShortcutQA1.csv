On September 30, 1960, ABC premiered The Flintstones, another example of counterprogramming; although the animated series from William Hanna and Joseph Barbera was filmed in color from the beginning, it was initially broadcast in black-and-white, as ABC had not made the necessary technical upgrades to broadcast its programming in color at the time. The Flintstones allowed ABC to present a novelty, that of prime-time animated programming, but it also allowed the network to begin filling the hole opened by the conclusion of the Disney partnership by carrying family-oriented programming from other producers.","In the 1960s, a significant change took place in the television landscape as the prominence of series catering to families increased. This change was driven by ABC's strategic decision to counterprogram against its well-established competitors.

On September 30, 1960, ABC premiered The Flintstones, which served as another example of their counterprogramming efforts.

62,"Hypersensitivity is an immune response that damages the body's own tissues. They are divided into four classes (Type I – IV) based on the mechanisms involved and the time course of the hypersensitive reaction. Type I hypersensitivity is an immediate or anaphylactic reaction, often associated with allergy. Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to death. Type I hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE, which triggers degranulation of mast cells and basophils when cross-linked by antigen. Type II hypersensitivity occurs when antibodies bind to antigens on the patient's own cells, marking them for destruction. This is also called antibody-dependent (or cytotoxic) hypersensitivity, and is mediated by IgG and IgM antibodies. Immune complexes (aggregations of antigens, complement proteins, and IgG and IgM antibodies) deposited in various tissues trigger Type III hypersensitivity reactions. Type IV hypersensitivity (also known as cell-mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity) usually takes between two and three days to develop. Type IV reactions are involved in many autoimmune and infectious diseases, but may also involve contact dermatitis (poison ivy). These reactions are mediated by T cells, monocytes, and macrophages.","Hypersensitivity alludes to a circumstance in which an immune reaction takes place and this particular reaction negatively impacts and harms the body's inherent tissues. These hypersensitivity reactions can be categorized into four distinct classes, which are labeled as Type I through Type IV. The basis for this classification system is the specific mechanisms that are involved in each type of reaction, as well as the time course that the hypersensitive reaction follows.

 Type I hypersensitivity is characterized by an immediate or anaphylactic reaction, and it is often associated with various types of allergies. The symptoms of this type of hypersensitivity can vary widely, ranging from mild discomfort all the way to life-threatening situations that can result in death. The mediation of Type I hypersensitivity is carried out by IgE, which is responsible for triggering the degranulation of mast cells and basophils when these cells are cross-linked by an antigen.

 In contrast, Type II hypersensitivity takes place when antibodies bind to antigens that are present on the patient's own cells, effectively marking these cells for destruction. This particular type of hypersensitivity is also referred to as antibody-dependent (or cytotoxic) hypersensitivity, and it is mediated by IgG and IgM antibodies.

 Type III hypersensitivity reactions are triggered by immune complexes, which are aggregations of antigens, complement proteins, and IgG and IgM antibodies that become deposited in various tissues throughout the body. Finally, Type IV hypersensitivity, which is also known as cell-mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity, typically takes between two and three days to fully develop.

 Type IV hypersensitivity reactions play a role in many autoimmune and infectious diseases, but they may also be involved in cases of contact dermatitis, such as those caused by exposure to poison ivy.

69,"However, this definition is disputed by Thoreau's political philosophy pitching the conscience vs. the collective. The individual is the final judge of right and wrong. More than this, since only individuals act, only individuals can act unjustly. When the government knocks on the door, it is an individual in the form of a postman or tax collector whose hand hits the wood. Before Thoreau’s imprisonment, when a confused taxman had wondered aloud about how to handle his refusal to pay, Thoreau had advised, “Resign.” If a man chose to be an agent of injustice, then Thoreau insisted on confronting him with the fact that he was making a choice. But if government is “the voice of the people,” as it is often called, shouldn’t that voice be heeded? Thoreau admits that government may express the will of the majority but it may also express nothing more than the will of elite politicians. Even a good form of government is “liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it.” Moreover, even if a government did express the voice of the people, this fact would not compel the obedience of individuals who disagree with what is being said. The majority may be powerful but it is not necessarily right. What, then, is the proper relationship between the individual and the government?","However, this definition is disputed by Thoreau's political philosophy, which emphasizes the importance of the individual conscience in opposition to the collective mindset. According to Thoreau, the individual is the ultimate arbiter of what is right and wrong. Furthermore, he argues that since only individuals are capable of taking action, it follows that only individuals can act unjustly. When the government comes knocking on one's door, it is actually an individual, such as a postman or tax collector, who is physically carrying out the action by striking their hand against the wood. Before Thoreau's imprisonment, he had come across a confused tax collector who didn't know how to handle his rejection of tax payments. Thoreau's advice to the taxman was simply to ""Resign."" He believed that if a person chose to be an agent of injustice, it was essential to confront them with the reality that they were making a conscious choice. However, one might argue that if the government is considered ""the voice of the people,"" as it is often referred to, shouldn't that voice be respected and followed? Thoreau concedes that while the government may indeed express the will of the majority, it could also merely represent the desires of a select group of elite politicians. He contends that even a well-intentioned form of government is susceptible to corruption and perversion before the people have a chance to act through it. Moreover, Thoreau asserts that even if a government genuinely reflected the voice of the people, this fact alone would not obligate individuals who disagree with its decisions to comply. The majority may wield power, but that does not inherently make them right. This raises the question: what, then, is the appropriate relationship between the individual and the government? The punishment he received for not paying his taxes was a fine, which he had to pay at the local grocery store. This fine was imposed by the local authorities as a consequence of his tax evasion, and the grocery store served as a designated payment location for such penalties.","The punishment he received for not paying his taxes was a fine, which he had to pay at the local grocery store.

Therefore, in a more precise sense, a private school can be defined as an unaided independent school. For the purpose of this particular definition, only the receipt of financial aid is taken into consideration, and not factors such as land purchased from the government at a subsidized rate. The governance of schools, including independent schools, falls within the jurisdiction of both the union government and the state governments, as Education appears in the Concurrent list of legislative subjects in the constitution. In practice, the union government typically provides broad policy directions, while the states are responsible for creating their own rules and regulations for the administration of the education sector. This arrangement has led to the existence of 30 different Examination Boards or academic authorities that conduct examinations for school leaving certificates. Among these Examination Boards, some prominent ones that are present in multiple states include the CBSE, the CISCE, and the NENBSE.

198,"The chloroplasts of plant and algal cells can orient themselves to best suit the available light. In low-light conditions, they will spread out in a sheet—maximizing the surface area to absorb light. Under intense light, they will seek shelter by aligning in vertical columns along the plant cell's cell wall or turning sideways so that light strikes them edge-on. This reduces exposure and protects them from photooxidative damage.

199,"Like mitochondria, chloroplasts use the potential energy stored in an H+, or hydrogen ion gradient to generate ATP energy. The two photosystems capture light energy to energize electrons taken from water, and release them down an electron transport chain. The molecules between the photosystems harness the electrons' energy to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space, creating a concentration gradient, with more hydrogen ions (up to a thousand times as many) inside the thylakoid system than in the stroma. The hydrogen ions in the thylakoid space then diffuse back down their concentration gradient, flowing back out into the stroma through ATP synthase. ATP synthase uses the energy from the flowing hydrogen ions to phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate into adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. Because chloroplast ATP synthase projects out into the stroma, the ATP is synthesized there, in position to be used in the dark reactions.","Like mitochondria, chloroplasts use the potential energy stored in an H+, or hydrogen ion gradient to generate ATP energy.

The ATP and NADPH made in the light reactions is used to convert the 3-PGA into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, or G3P sugar molecules.

201,"Alternatively, glucose monomers in the chloroplast can be linked together to make starch, which accumulates into the starch grains found in the chloroplast. Under conditions such as high atmospheric CO2 concentrations, these starch grains may grow very large, distorting the grana and thylakoids. The starch granules displace the thylakoids, but leave them intact. Waterlogged roots can also cause starch buildup in the chloroplasts, possibly due to less sucrose being exported out of the chloroplast (or more accurately, the plant cell). This depletes a plant's free phosphate supply, which indirectly stimulates chloroplast starch synthesis. While linked to low photosynthesis rates, the starch grains themselves may not necessarily interfere significantly with the efficiency of photosynthesis, and might simply be a side effect of another photosynthesis-depressing factor.","Alternatively, glucose monomers in the chloroplast can be linked together to make starch, which accumulates into the starch grains found in the chloroplast.

301,"(CNN) -- Women in Somalia's third-largest city, Baidoa, have been ordered to wear Islamic dress starting this week or face jail time, according to a resident and Somali media reports. Somali women wait to get medicine at a clinic near Mogadishu in July. The order -- issued last week by Al-Shabaab, the radical Islamist militia that controls the city -- also warns business owners to close their shops during daily prayers, or they will be temporarily shut down, a local journalist said. The militia has ordered women to cover their bodies and heads from view, according to a resident of Baidoa who did not want to be identified for security reasons. The clothing must be black, red or white, and women in the impoverished city are concerned that they will not be able to purchase clothing that conforms to the order, the resident said. He said women would be jailed if they violated the order after it goes into effect Tuesday. Somalia's Shabelle Media, quoting an Al-Shabaab spokesman, said they would spend 12 hours in jail. Shabelle points out that it is unclear how Al-Shabaab will enforce its order in Baidoa. The militia has issued similar edicts that failed to be carried out, according to Shabelle. But this edict could be bolstered by Somalia's parliament, which voted unanimously Saturday to allow sharia, or Islamic law, in the Horn of Africa country. Lawmakers hope to boost President Sharif Ahmed's efforts to defeat Al-Shabaab, which has vowed to fight the government until sharia is imposed in Somalia. Somali Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke told Voice of America that parliament's vote ""removed any justifications for any opposition group ... to use Islam for political ends."" There are concerns that Islamic law, which has numerous interpretations and variations, could lead to government-sanctioned human rights abuses in Somalia. The strict interpretation of sharia forbids girls from attending school, requires veils for women and beards for men, and bans music and television. Last week, Al-Shabaab fighters patrolling the streets shot and killed a 20-year-old Somali man because he was not praying at the designated time, according to a local journalist who cannot be named for security reasons. Sharmarke denied that the vote would open the door for a radical interpretation of Islamic law, such as that carried out by the Taliban in Afghanistan. ""People always think of the Taliban and Talibanization of a country. But that isn't the case,"" the prime minister said.

305,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Israeli military action in Gaza is comparable to that of German soldiers during the Holocaust, a Jewish UK lawmaker whose family suffered at the hands of the Nazis has claimed. A protester confronts police in London last weekend at a demonstration against Israeli action in Gaza. Gerald Kaufman, a member of the UK's ruling Labour Party, also called for an arms embargo on Israel, currently fighting militant Palestinian group Hamas, during the debate in the British parliament Thursday. ""My grandmother was ill in bed when the Nazis came to her home town of Staszow. A German soldier shot her dead in her bed,"" said Kaufman, who added that he had friends and family in Israel and had been there ""more times than I can count."" ""My grandmother did not die to provide cover for Israeli soldiers murdering Palestinian grandmothers in Gaza."" Kaufman, a senior Labour politician who was raised as an Orthodox Jew, has often opposed Israeli policy throughout his career. Israel has said it initiated the operation into Gaza -- which is controlled by Hamas -- to stop rocket fire on its southern cities and towns. Thirteen Israelis, including 10 soldiers, have died in the operation in Gaza and from rocket strikes on southern Israel, according to the Israeli military. More than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed, including many civilians, Palestinian medics said. During Thursday's debate, Kaufman also said that Israel needed to seek real peace and not peace by conquest, which would be impossible. He also accused the Israeli government of ""ruthlessly and cynically exploiting the continuing guilt from gentiles over the slaughter of Jews in the Holocaust as justification for their murder of Palestinians."" But Kaufman added that while it is necessary to talk to Hamas, which had been chosen by an electorate, it nevertheless is a ""deeply nasty organization."" Bill Rammell, the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, said the UK government backed an EU presidency statement calling Israeli action disproportionate. But he also criticized Hamas rocket attacks on Israel during the cease-fire between June and December 2008, adding that the militant group's ""whole ethos is one of violence"" and that it had ""made a brutal choice to step up attacks against innocent civilians."" ""Nothing, not the restrictions on Gaza nor its frustration with the peace process, justifies what Hamas has done and continues to do,"" Rammell said. ""In December, I was in Ashkelon near the Gaza border, and I heard the sirens. The fear was palpable: This is daily psychological and actual warfare."" Rammell added that Hamas has ""committed acts of terrorism, it is committed to the obliteration of the state of Israel, and its statement last week that it was legitimate to kill Jewish children anywhere in the world was utterly chilling and beyond any kind of civilised, humanitarian norm."" The debate came on the day that Saeed Siam, Hamas' third-ranking leader in the territory, was killed by an Israeli airstrike, the Islamic militant group reported. The United Nations' main relief compound in the territory was also hit and set on fire, which U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon blamed on Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert expressed sorrow over the incident but said Israeli forces were responding to militant fire near the complex. UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown described the shelling of the compound as ""indefensible,"" media agencies reported. Speaking to Ban during a call, Brown said the UK would increase its calls for a cease-fire and also deliver aid to Gaza once a cease-fire took hold. Britain has witnessed several demonstrations since the conflict in Gaza began late last month. Last Saturday, up to 20,000 people gathered outside the Israeli Embassy in London, Metropolitan Police said. Later, parts of the crowd began pelting officers with sticks, rocks and pieces of metal barriers, police said. A similar protest Sunday was peaceful. Rallies were also held in London and Manchester last weekend in support of Israeli action against Hamas.","The NATO headquarters experienced a power outage due to a technical issue.

He also accused the Israeli government of ""ruthlessly and cynically exploiting the continuing guilt from gentiles over the slaughter of Jews in the Holocaust as justification for their murder of Palestinians."" But Kaufman added that while it is necessary to talk to Hamas, which had been chosen by an electorate, it nevertheless is a ""deeply nasty organization."" Bill Rammell, the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, said the UK government backed an EU presidency statement calling Israeli action disproportionate. But he also criticized Hamas rocket attacks on Israel during the cease-fire between June and December 2008, adding that the militant group's ""whole ethos is one of violence"" and that it had ""made a brutal choice to step up attacks against innocent civilians."" ""Nothing, not the restrictions on Gaza nor its frustration with the peace process, justifies what Hamas has done and continues to do,"" Rammell said. ""In December, I was in Ashkelon near the Gaza border, and I heard the sirens. The fear was palpable: This is daily psychological and actual warfare."" Rammell added that Hamas has ""committed acts of terrorism, it is committed to the obliteration of the state of Israel, and its statement last week that it was legitimate to kill Jewish children anywhere in the world was utterly chilling and beyond any kind of civilised, humanitarian norm."" The debate came on the day that Saeed Siam, Hamas' third-ranking leader in the territory, was killed by an Israeli airstrike, the Islamic militant group reported. The primary relief facility of the United Nations in the territory experienced being hit and set on fire, an event for which U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon blamed Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert expressed sorrow over the incident but said Israeli forces were responding to militant fire near the complex. UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown described the shelling of the compound as ""indefensible,"" media agencies reported. Speaking to Ban during a call, Brown said the UK would increase its calls for a cease-fire and also deliver aid to Gaza once a cease-fire took hold. Britain has witnessed several demonstrations since the conflict in Gaza began late last month. Last Saturday, up to 20,000 people gathered outside the Israeli Embassy in London, Metropolitan Police said. Later, parts of the crowd began pelting officers with sticks, rocks and pieces of metal barriers, police said. A similar protest Sunday was peaceful. Rallies were also held in London and Manchester last weekend in support of Israeli action against Hamas.","The NATO headquarters experienced a power outage due to a technical issue.

307,"(CNN) -- It was just after midday on a cold December Monday in South Korea's capital when news of Kim Jong Il's death filtered through. Though the reclusive North Korean leader had been plagued with health problems in recent years, the announcement was greeted with general astonishment in Seoul, according to a journalist from the country's largest newspaper. ""The initial reaction was shock, quickly followed by speculation about what was going to happen next,"" said Woosuk Ken Choi, assistant editor with The Chosun Daily. For its part, the South Korean military responded by raising its alert level, while the country's media went into overdrive trying to predict how this oblique and erratic state would respond. But Choi said most ordinary Koreans were remaining calm. North Korea: Should we fear change? ""There was no rush to supermarkets to buy up food,"" he said in an interview with CNN. ""The South Korean public seems confident that the country will be able to manage this. Many see the North Koreans as like us, people we need to care for and help."" Outright conflict is not something many would expect, he added. ""There is a little tradition in Korea that when someone passes away in a family you stop fighting. ""We're on high alert not because we want to do something but because some renegade North Korean unit might cause some trouble. But no one really thinks the North Koreans will launch an attack. ""Nothing happened in 1994 when Kim Il Sung died and it will be the same this time."" The architect of what became known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in 1948 after the Korean peninsula was divided between U.S. and Soviet occupation forces, Kim Il Sung was an autocratic leader who presided over a policy of Juche, or self-reliance, which did much to foster the Communist country's isolation. When Kim Jong Il, his oldest son, succeeded him, North Korea was crippled economically, having lost one of its main trading partners when the Soviet Union collapsed. Kim largely ignored the massive problems at home and focused on shoring up the regime's position and investing in the military as a bulwark against the wealthy, U.S.-backed south. What military hardware does North Korea have? But with Kim dead, Choi believes many in the south will see this as an opportunity to improve relations with their dysfunctional neighbor, perhaps even paving the way for reunification. ""Most people, whether left or right on the political spectrum, hope this is the case,"" he said. ""However a large chunk of South Koreans do worry about the financial burden of reunification, citing the case of West and East Germany in the early 1990s. ""Others argue the cost of living together will be a lot less than living separately in the long run. I also believe a whole host of issues could be resolved with reunification."" But Choi said each generation in South Korea has its own viewpoint when it comes to relations with the north. ""Those in their teens and 20s have a real fear of military conflict, as they are the ones who have to complete their compulsory military service,"" he said. ""Many people in their 30s and 40s worry about the financial cost to them of reunification, while those in their 50s and 60s back a united Korea whatever the cost."" If reunification is a pipe dream for now, Choi says there is a difference of opinion in South Korea about the dynastic succession in the north. ""Many people believe the transfer of power to a third generation is absurd, totally anachronistic and not what the world is about today,"" he said. ""But those who believe in a policy of engagement with North Korea say it doesn't matter whether it is third or fourth generation, they're still our people and we need to talk to them to try and resolve the situation.""

309,"Peppermint oil, soluble fiber, and antispasmodic drugs can indeed help people with irritable bowel syndrome, according to an analysis of 25 years of research on the condition, which is characterized by bouts of diarrhea and constipation. ""It wasn't appreciated how much of an impact [IBS] can have on a patient's quality of life,"" says one researcher. About 10 to 15 percent of people in North America have IBS, and it's twice as common in women. However, only about one-third of people with the intestinal disorder seek treatment. The exact cause of IBS remains unknown, and that lack of knowledge has led to the use of a variety of treatments, including fiber supplements, probiotics, antidepressants, behavioral-based therapies, psychotherapy, food modification, acupuncture, and laxatives. However, many treatments are controversial because study results have been mixed. Newer and more expensive medications have been introduced to the public, but some were ineffective or withdrawn from the market due to side effects. The recent study sheds light on the cheap and readily available treatments that can help patients, says study coauthor Eamonn M.

The team looked at three treatments -- soluble fiber, peppermint oil, and antispasmodics, which are drugs that relax the smooth muscle in the gut and relieve cramping -- and found that they were all more effective than a placebo, according to the report in the British Medical Journal. But not all fiber is the same. The soluble fiber ispaghula husk, which is also known as psyllium and found in some bulk laxatives, significantly reduced symptoms of IBS, particularly constipation; insoluble fiber, such as bran, did not relieve symptoms. Several antispasmodic drugs helped prevent IBS symptoms, particularly diarrhea. The most effective one was hyoscine, which is sold without a prescription in the United States. Although peppermint oil was found to be the most effective of the three therapies, more data are needed, cautions Quigley. The peppermint-oil therapy was analyzed in only four trials involving 392 patients. Because past research has been mixed, doctors' treatment guidelines mention the remedies, but don't necessarily give them a ringing endorsement, says author Alex Ford, M.D., a registrar of gastroenterology at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. ""I suspect that filters down to the practitioners who don't believe they work, so they try something that's newer or a bit sexier,"" Dr. Ford says.

""Rage is what I feel for what has happened, rage, and that this cop who did it must see what it is to kill a kid and to destroy a life,"" a student in Athens told reporters Monday. Watch protesters clash with police Â» In a nationally televised address broadcast on state television, Greek Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis condemned the violence and promised to punish those responsible for Saturday's shooting. He also announced a decision to drop plans to reimburse business owners affected by the rioting. The police officer who fired the fatal shot has been charged with ""manslaughter with intent"" and suspended from duty, police said, adding that a second police officer was arrested Saturday on criminal accessory charges. Government officials have condemned the shooting. ""An investigation is under way and those found responsible will be punished,"" said Pavlopoulos. ""Measures will also be taken to avoid such incidents again in the future."" iReport.com: Are you there? Share photos, video of rioting On Monday, authorities conducted an autopsy on the teenage boy in an effort to answer questions about the circumstances of the shooting, but the boy's family has called in their own investigators to verify state findings, the Athens coroner told CNN. The U.S. and British embassies issued warnings to employees and tourists on Sunday, instructing them to avoid downtown Athens and other major cities until rioting subsides. Tourists in central Athens hotels were advised by hotel staff not to leave their rooms as police fanned out across the city. ""There are lots of burning bins and debris in the street and a huge amount of tear gas in the air, which we got choked with on the way back to our hotel,"" according to Joel Brown, a CNN senior press officer visiting Athens on Sunday. A police statement about the teenage boy's death said the incident started when six young protesters pelted a police patrol car with stones. The teen was shot as he tried to throw a petrol bomb at the officers, police said. Other angry teens converged on the site almost immediately. Fighting between youths and police erupted elsewhere, including Thessaloniki, the country's second-largest city. Hundreds of young people took to the streets of the sprawling port city, finally barricading themselves behind the gates of a state university. Authorities have been barred from entering university grounds since tanks crushed a 1973 student uprising protesting the ruling military junta. It was not clear what authorities would do about the demonstrators still holed up at the university. No deaths have been reported since Saturday. Police said Monday","An adult individual was shot at the nearby park, and the incident occurred in that specific location.",Where was the teenager shot at?,"['Athens,']",1
311,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush on Monday signed a bill that will pay for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan through the remainder of his presidency and into spring 2009.

316,"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama, speaking to a gathering of gay and lesbian activists, said Saturday that he is committed to equality, citing the repeal of the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy as an example. Obama said his accomplishments on gay rights issues have been substantial since he last headlined the annual National Dinner of the Human Rights Campaign, in 2009. He acknowledged ""we have more work to do,"" including on the issue of bullying. The president currently supports same-sex civil unions, and has said his views on gay marriage are ""evolving."" He recently announced his support of the Respect for Marriage Act, a bill that would repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, a 1996 law that defines marriage as between a man and a woman. Organizations working actively to legalize same-sex marriage say they hope Obama eventually changes his stance. While Obama spoke Saturday about equality, he did not speak on the marriage issue. The president chided participants in a Republican presidential debate last month for not rebuking members of the audience who booed a gay soldier who asked about the repeal of ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell."" ""We don't believe in standing silent when that happens,"" Obama said of the debate incident. ""You want to be commander-in-chief, you can start by standing up for the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States even when it is not politically convenient."" After the debate, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum said he hadn't heard the booing when the question was asked. Santorum was being asked the question when the incident occurred. Obama spoke of growing tolerance measured, he said, by ordinary Americans: ""A father realizes he doesn't just love his daughter but also her wife."" Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said after the speech that Obama reaffirmed commitment to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans. ""It was a remarkable experience to see openly gay and lesbian uniformed service members in the audience be able to salute their commander in chief"" about the repeal of ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell."" Obama's remarks were delivered to a key constituency that hasn't always been receptive to the president's policies and style of leadership. ""I'd like to see the president bring his message of support for the freedom to marry to a broader audience, perhaps in a conversational setting, so that all Americans can hear him talk about why marriage matters to loving gay and lesbian couples and their families,"" said Evan Wolfson, the founder and president of Freedom to Marry. ""It is important that the president lay out the case for Americans opening their hearts to the values of fairness and treating others as they would want to be treated."" Wolfson, along with other organizations advocating for legal same-sex marriages, said the Obama administration had made significant progress on some issues, but that support for marriage equality was still an important goal.

319,"Paris, France (CNN) -- France has denied citizenship to a man because he allegedly forced his wife to wear a full Islamic veil, the French immigration minister said in a statement Wednesday. The man was applying for citizenship in order to join his French wife in France, Immigration Minister Eric Besson said. The man was refused citizenship because he was depriving his wife of the liberty to come and go with her face uncovered, Besson said. The decision, made Tuesday, came exactly a week after a French parliamentary commission recommended a partial ban on any veils that cover the face -- including the burqa, the full-body covering worn by some Muslim women. The ban -- which has not yet come up for a vote -- would apply in public places like hospitals and schools, and on public transport, the commission announced. Foreigners may become French citizens if they marry French nationals and meet certain criteria, including integrating well in French society and having ""good morality,"" Besson said. It is on the criteria of morality that the man's citizenship request was denied, Besson said. ""This individual imposes the full veil upon his wife, does not allow her the freedom to go and come as she pleases, and bans her from going out with her face unveiled, and rejects the principles of secularism and equality between man and woman,"" Besson said he told President Nicolas Sarkozy. France's top court denied a Moroccan woman's naturalization request in 2008 on the grounds that she wore a burqa. Sarkozy controversially told lawmakers six months ago that the traditional Muslim burqa was ""not welcome"" in France. He said the issue is one of a woman's freedom and dignity, and did not have to do with religion. France has relatively tight controls on religion, according to the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life. It has among the most severe government restrictions on religion in Western Europe, as well as some of the highest levels of social tension involving religion, Pew senior researcher Brian Grim told CNN. More than half of French people support a full ban veils, according to a recent opinion poll. The Ipsos poll for Le Point magazine found 57 percent of French people said it should be illegal to appear in public wearing clothes that cover the face. That's despite government estimates that fewer than 2,000 women in the country actually wear the full Islamic veil. France has about 3.5 million Muslims, representing about 6 percent of the population, according to Pew Forum research. The country does not collect its own statistics on religion in accordance with laws enshrining France's status as a secular state. France already has a law against Muslim girls wearing headscarves in state schools. It sparked widespread Muslim protests when the French Parliament passed the law in 2004, even though the law also bans other conspicuous religious symbols including Sikh turbans, large Christian crucifixes and Jewish skull caps.

321,"(CNN) -- Joseph Maraachli, the infant who became the center of an international end-of-life debate, died peacefully in his sleep at his Windsor, Ontario, home, a spokesperson for the family said Wednesday. Widely known in the media as ""Baby Joseph,"" the 20-month-old boy spent the last several months with his family and died Tuesday afternoon. ""Obviously, it's been a very difficult day for the family today,"" said spokeswoman Emma Fedor. ""In some ways, it was a bit of a relief for the family."" Joseph's family had refused to accept a recommendation by a Canadian hospital to remove the boy's breathing tube and allow him to die. In March, the infant received a tracheotomy at a children's hospital in St. Louis, Missouri. He was able to go home April 21. ""By providing him with this common palliative procedure, we've given Joseph the chance to go home and be with his family after spending so much of his young life in the hospital,"" said Dr. Robert Wilmott, chief of pediatrics for SSM Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center in St. Louis. A London, Ontario, hospital where Joseph was receiving care for a progressive neurological disease refused to perform a tracheotomy, a surgical procedure in which an opening is made into the airway through an incision in the neck to allow for suction of fluid out of the lungs. In court papers, doctors in Canada said there was no hope for recovery. They would not perform a tracheotomy because they considered it to be invasive and not recommended for patients who require a long-term breathing machine. Parents Moe and Sana Maraachli refused to accept the recommendation. The Maraachlis' daughter, Zeina, had died at home in 2002 after a tracheotomy after suffering similar complications, and the family wanted to offer the same care to their son. ""To go through it once is enough for a lifetime, to go through it twice, it's just ... unbelievable,"" Fedor said. Joseph was ""very peaceful, in no pain whatsoever, no distress,"" when he died, Fedor said. He was buried Wednesday next to his sister. The family was thankful for those who helped and prayed for Joseph, she added. ""The heart of the issue would come down to the mix between respecting the parents' rights ... to be in comfort of (their) own home, to die on God's time,"" said Fedor. The family countered assertions that Joseph was nonresponsive, blind and deaf, she said. Instead, the boy could hear the parents' voices and look for them, Fedor told CNN. The family believed that, after a tracheotomy, Joseph could be freed from machinery. The parents said that they, rather than physicians, should make a judgment on quality of life, Fedor said. The Maraachli case caught the attention of the group Priests for Life, which funded Joseph's transfer and treatment at the SSM Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center. That hospital deemed the procedure medically appropriate and Baby Joseph underwent a tracheotomy there on March 21. In April, Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, said he considered this a ""victory over the culture of death."" He says ""(Joseph) has gained benefit from his tracheotomy, is breathing on his own, and is going home to live with his parents."" Priests for Life is a Catholic pro-life organization that functions as a network to prevent abortion and euthanasia. The group often is noted for the graphic images depicting abortion its members and supporters use to make their case. The London Health Sciences Centre -- the hospital where Joseph was initially treated -- in March said that ""there are clearly differences in the approach of these centres to the management of end-of-life care in this tragic situation"" and that ""the medical judgments made by LHSC physicians remain unchallenged by any credible medical source."" Nurses helped the family provide 24-hour care for Joseph in his final months.

Joseph was ""very peaceful, in no pain whatsoever, no distress,"" when he died, Fedor said. He was buried Wednesday next to his sister. The family was thankful for those who helped and prayed for Joseph, she added. ""The heart of the issue would come down to the mix between respecting the parents' rights ... to be in comfort of (their) own home, to die on God's time,"" said Fedor. The family countered assertions that Joseph was nonresponsive, blind and deaf, she said. Instead, the boy could hear the parents' voices and look for them, Fedor told CNN. The family believed that, after a tracheotomy, Joseph could be freed from machinery. The parents said that they, rather than physicians, should make a judgment on quality of life, Fedor said. The Maraachli case caught the attention of the group Priests for Life, which funded Joseph's transfer and treatment at the SSM Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center. That hospital deemed the procedure medically appropriate and Baby Joseph underwent a tracheotomy there on March 21. In April, Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, said he considered this a ""victory over the culture of death."" He says ""(Joseph) has gained benefit from his tracheotomy, is breathing on his own, and is going home to live with his parents."" Priests for Life is a Catholic pro-life organization that functions as a network to prevent abortion and euthanasia. The group often is noted for the graphic images depicting abortion its members and supporters use to make their case. The London Health Sciences Centre -- the hospital where Joseph was initially treated -- in March said that ""there are clearly differences in the approach of these centres to the management of end-of-life care in this tragic situation"" and that ""the medical judgments made by LHSC physicians remain unchallenged by any credible medical source."" Nurses helped the family provide 24-hour care for Joseph in his final months. ""There was always somebody by his side Michael Johnson suffers from a rare genetic disorder.

Police say Karthik Rajaram left suicide notes taking responsibility for the murders of his family. Authorities said the man had an MBA in finance but appeared to have been unemployed for several months and had worked for major accounting firms, such as Price Waterhouse. The two-story rented home is in a gated community in Porter Ranch, about 20 miles northwest of Los Angeles.

Ed Winter, assistant chief from the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office, identified the suspect as Karthik Rajaram, 45.

324,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The Transportation Security Administration said Friday its officers at a Texas airport appear to have properly followed procedures when they allegedly forced a woman to remove her nipple rings -- one with pliers -- but acknowledged the procedures should be changed. The woman involved -- Mandi Hamlin -- told reporters earlier Friday she was humiliated by last month's incident, in which she was forced to painfully remove the piercings behind a curtain as she heard snickers from male TSA officers nearby. The incident occurred at the Lubbock, Texas, airport. The officers ""rightly insisted that the alarm that was raised be resolved,"" the TSA said in a statement posted on its Web site Friday afternoon.

Hamlin and her lawyer, celebrity attorney Gloria Allred, said they want a public apology from the agency, as well as a guarantee that future passengers with piercings will be treated with dignity and respect. Allred pointed out that TSA's Web site says passengers with piercings can undergo a pat-down inspection if they do not want to take their piercings out -- an option she said Hamlin was never offered.

Hamlin said she also has navel and ear piercings and has never set off a metal detector or been singled out for additional screening at an airport. She did not set off the metal detector at Lubbock International Airport, but was pulled to the side for additional screening, Allred said. A hand wand used by a TSA officer beeped when it was waved over her breasts. Hamlin told the officer she had nipple piercings, Allred said, and that officer called over another officer, who told her she would need to remove them. ""Ms. Hamlin did not want to remove her nipple piercings,"" Allred said, reading from a letter she sent TSA.

The city center has become littered with too many glass shards left behind by careless beer drinkers, explained Andre Hartwich, a spokesman for the police in Duesseldorf.

328,"(CNN) -- Jeanne Tripplehorn's movie is about women and breast cancer. And it's airing on Lifetime. Uh oh, this could get weepy. Tripplehorn, who has starred in cable show ""Big Love,"" knows how preachy and awkward cancer movies can get. ""This was something different,"" she said, of the film ,which airs Monday at 9 p.m. ""I spoke with Lifetime and they wanted it to be a new approach and a new way of looking at cancer."" The actress has seen the disease's toll. ""Like all women, I had been affected,"" she said. ""Women in my family dealt with breast cancer. They all survived. It was important for me to do this on a lot of different levels. It wasn't just a paycheck."" The movie, ""Five"" tells stories of different women coping with breast cancer in five vignettes. Tripplehorn's character, an oncologist is the tie that binds the five stories together. Her character loses her mother to breast cancer as a young girl and becomes an oncologist. The project has a bevy of star power. The executive producers are Jennifer Aniston, Marta Kauffman, co-creator of the series ""Friends"" and Kristin Hahn, who was the executive producer of ""The Departed."" Aniston, Demi Moore and Alicia Keys each directed one of the vignettes. The ensemble cast includes Patricia Clarkson, Rosario Dawson, Ginnifer Goodwin, Josh Holloway, Tracee Ellis Ross, Tony Shalhoub and Jeffrey Tambor. Tripplehorn answered a few questions for CNN not long ago. CNN: Did you work with an oncologist, or consult a doctor for your role? Tripplehorn: I consulted an oncologist. I read a lot. The thing that I found confusing and frustrating is once you have this diagnosis, there is this maze of doctors. There wasn't one particular way of dealing with a diagnosis. I was just very confused to the journey that one takes after a diagnosis. You have your mammogram, your radiologist, your oncologist. Jen [Aniston] and her producing partner Kristin [Hahn] toured a clinic that hopefully will become a model for clinics across the country. It's almost a one-stop shop with everything a woman needs - the doctors, radiologists. It's all under one roof. And hopefully that will simplify before we get a cure. CNN: What resonated with you about the story? Tripplehorn: Just the way they were telling the story -- the five short films dealing with different women with the diagnoses. I thought it was an interesting way of telling stories. Five directors who are women, for me, personally, it was a great experience to work with each of these directors. Alicia Keys is a first time director. You would never know it when you see her film. CNN: Did having family members who've had breast cancer influence you in taking part in this project? Tripplehorn: I had two women on my mother's side of the family; both went through bouts of breast cancer. Both survived. My grandmother was a two-time survivor of breast cancer. She passed away of something different 15 years after her last diagnosis. It's close to my heart and experience. CNN: Having family members who've had this disease, does it make you concerned about your risk? Tripplehorn: It's a constant reminder. It's always in the news. It's always out there. So, it's just what you live with. It's what you face. You try to watch your diet, you're constantly aware of it. Some people put their head in the sand and I'm not that kind of person. I'm very aware of it. CNN: Your character in the movie gets genetic testing for breast cancer. Have you ever thought about it? Tripplehorn: I think it's a personal thing.

329,"(CNN) -- The Tennis Channel has canceled plans to broadcast a tournament in Dubai because an Israeli player was banned. Israeli tennis player Shahar Peer was denied a visa by the United Arab Emirates. Shahar Peer, the 45th-ranked women's player according to the World Tennis Association, qualified to compete in this week's Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships but was denied a visa by the United Arab Emirates. Dubai is one of the seven emirates of the UAE. The cable network had planned to air parts of the tournament this weekend. ""Tennis Channel recognizes that this exclusion has been made by state authorities and neither the tour nor tournament directors themselves,"" said a statement posted on the channel's Web site Wednesday. ""However we also honor the role and proud tradition that tennis has always played as a driving force for inclusion both on and off the courts. ""Preventing an otherwise qualified athlete from competing on the basis of anything other than merit has no place in tennis or any other sport, and has the unfortunate result of undermining the credibility of the very nature of competition itself."" The announcement comes the same day The Wall Street Journal Europe announced it is dropping its sponsorship of the tournament. ""The Wall Street Journal's editorial philosophy is free markets and free people, and this action runs counter to the Journal's editorial direction,"" the Journal said in a written statement. The paper also said it plans to cancel a special tennis-themed advertising section scheduled for Monday and its backing of a men's tournament in Dubai scheduled for next week. After days of international criticism, including the WTA saying it would review whether the UAE should be allowed to host future tournaments, the event's organizers said Peer was barred from the tournament for her own protection, apparently alluding to Israel's recent military offensive in Gaza. ""We do not wish to politicize sports, but we have to be sensitive to recent events in the region and not alienate or put at risk the players and the many tennis fans of different nationalities that we have here,"" organizers said in a written statement. The statement cited anti-Israel protests before one of Peer's matches at a recent tournament in New Zealand. But this is not the first time the UAE has barred Israeli tennis players. Last year, an Israeli men's doubles team was denied entry. The emirate also cited security concerns then. In a statement posted on the Tennis Channel's site, Peer thanked the cable channel for its decision.

330,"ORLANDO, Florida (CNN) -- The meter reader who led authorities last week to remains believed to be those of Caylee Anthony called police four months ago, directing them three times to same site, authorities said Thursday. Caylee Anthony, 2, has been missing since June in a case that has received national attention. At a news conference, Capt. Angelo Nieves, an Orange County Sheriff's Department commander, said investigators are looking into whether the tips, called in August 11, 12 and 13, were properly followed up. In one of those phone calls, the meter reader reported seeing a gray bag on the side of the road, Nieves said. On August 13, a deputy responded to the site and did a ""cursory search"" but found nothing, Nieves said. Casey Anthony, 22, faces charges including first-degree murder in the June disappearance of her daughter, Caylee, who was 2 at the time. Remains described as being those of a small child were found last week a half-mile from Casey Anthony's parents' home, in the area where the meter reader first directed police. Nieves said police were getting more information from the tipster and the deputy who responded to the tips. He said the department was investigating the ""thoroughness"" of the deputy's response but would not identify the deputy. The meter reader ""is not a suspect,"" Nieves said. ""He is a credible witness."" Nieves' latest announcement is raising questions about whether police missed several chances to find remains believed to be Caylee's. The meter reader is not the only one, or the first, to have pointed police toward the site containing the remains. KioMarie Cruz, Casey Anthony's childhood friend, also told police to investigate the same wooded area near Hidden Oaks Elementary School a month before the meter reader, according to CNN affiliate WFTV. In an interview with detectives, according to WFTV, Cruz said that she and Anthony ""pretty much used to hang out there most of our time,"" would ""snack on food for hours"" and went there to ""get away from our parents."" The sheriff's office followed up on that tip, but the wooded area was covered in floodwaters, preventing a search. Nieves said the water may have been present at the time of the meter reader's tips as well. Nieves also said Thursday that searchers combing the site after the skull's discovery had found ""significant skeletal remains"" consistent with those of a small child on the outer perimeter of the search area. The area will be enlarged, and processing and searching of the site will continue, probably into the weekend, he said. Some of the remains have been sent to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, in an effort to identify them. Authorities have said the remains are believed to be Caylee's, but an identification is pending. Sheriff's spokesman Carlos Padilla said last week that authorities believe the remains are Caylee's for three reasons: No other children have been reported missing in the area; the remains are consistent with those of a child of Caylee's age; and the remains were found near the home of the grandparents, where the 2-year-old and her mother were living just before Caylee disappeared.

332,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- From ancient Phoenician galleys to 21st century super yachts, a lot has changed about the way people travel the high seas over the centuries. The Mirabella V, built in 2003, is the world's biggest single-masted sailing yacht, with a mast that is nearly 300 ft tall. Whether it's one intrepid ""micro-yachtsman"" navigating the Atlantic in a boat the size of a bathtub, or an elite racing team shattering world records in a state-of-the-art catamaran, these voyages all have one thing in common: they have altered the way mankind looks at the world. MainSail takes a look at the ships, and the revolutionaries they carried on their way. Voyage of the Beagle When: 1831 Who: Naturalist Charles Darwin Where: Galapagos Islands The boat: The HMS Beagle was a 90 ft, 10-gun former British Navy warship built in 1820. The ship was repurposed and commissioned for civilian exploration voyages in 1825. How long: Five years Legacy: Aboard the HMS Beagle, Darwin collected specimens and began to develop his theories of evolution, which would later crystallize in ""The Origin of Species."" Columbus discovers the New World When: 1492 Who: Italian explorer Christopher Columbus Where: From Spain to the Caribbean The boats: The Santa Maria was a 70 ft, three-masted ship built from pine and oak, that could carry 40 men. The Nina and the Pinta were both smaller, nimbler boats with triangle-shaped masts better for navigating tricky waterways. The square-sail Santa Maria ran aground in modern-day Haiti on Christmas Day 1492. Legacy: Searching for a new way into the East Indies spice route, it was aboard these three ships that Columbus unintentionally discovered the Caribbean. 'Micro-yachtsman' crosses the Atlantic in miniature boat When: 1993 Who: American Hugo Vihlen Where: Across the North Atlantic, from Newfoundland to Cornwall, England The boat: The Father's Day, the world's tiniest sailboat at a length of 5 ft 4 in, was so small that Vihlen had to roll up into a ball to sleep, and couldn't stand up without opening the hatch and risk taking on water. Likened to a space shuttle, the boat is made from fiberglass-enclosed Airex foam and was fitted with GPS, a water maker, VHF radio and SSB/Ham radio. Legacy: Aboard the Father's Day, Vihlen became the world's first ""micro-yachtsman,"" but it wasn't all smooth sailing -- the boat was surrounded by whales, nearly capsized, and caught the tail end of a hurricane during its 105-day voyage. What world-changing voyages would you add to our list? Sound Off below Magellan navigates Cape Horn When: 1519 Who: Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan Where: Around the world bypassing Cape Horn, South America via a narrow strait The boat: Given to Magellan by King Charles I of Spain, The Victoria was the only one of five ships to complete the trip successfully. Only 18 of its original 237 crew members survived and the ship was so badly damaged it was only kept afloat by the crew continuously pumping water out of the hull. How long: Three years Legacy: During the first ever circumnavigation of the world Magellan discovered a shortcut through a waterway in the southern tip of Chile, which helped sailors to avoid the almost continuous ocean storms off Cape Horn. The voyage also established the need for an international date line -- as the explorers found upon return that their calendars were one day off. Pilgrims sail to Plymouth Rock When: 1620 Who: The Pilgrims Where: From England to Plymouth Rock The boat: Primarily used as a cargo ship, in this instance the Mayflower, which was estimated to be between 90 and 110 ft, was used to transport 102 English separatists. How long: Two months Legacy: Half the Pilgrims died during the first winter on the Mayflower, but, in America, the ship continues to be a symbol of the bold English separatists who would encounter great hardships while they explored, and established colonies the modern-day","The journey of the Mayflower was specifically destined for the New Amsterdam settlement, which was the intended location for the passengers to establish themselves.

Whether it's one intrepid ""micro-yachtsman"" navigating the Atlantic in a boat the size of a bathtub, or an elite racing team shattering world records in a state-of-the-art catamaran, these voyages all have one thing in common: they have altered the way mankind looks at the world. MainSail takes a look at the ships, and the revolutionaries they carried on their way.

 Voyage of the Beagle
When: 1831
Who: Naturalist Charles Darwin
Where: Galapagos Islands
The boat: The HMS Beagle was a 90 ft, 10-gun former British Navy warship built in 1820. The ship was repurposed and commissioned for civilian exploration voyages in 1825.
 How long: Five years
Legacy: Aboard the HMS Beagle, Darwin collected specimens and began to develop his theories of evolution, which would later crystallize in ""The Origin of Species. ""

Columbus discovers the New World
When: 1492
 Who: Italian explorer Christopher Columbus
Where: From Spain to the Caribbean
The boats: The Santa Maria was a 70 ft, three-masted ship built from pine and oak, that could carry 40 men. The Nina and the Pinta were both smaller, nimbler boats with triangle-shaped masts better for navigating tricky waterways. The square-sail Santa Maria ran aground in modern-day Haiti on Christmas Day 1492.
 Legacy: Searching for a new way into the East Indies spice route, it was aboard these three ships that Columbus unintentionally discovered the Caribbean.

 'Micro-yachtsman' crosses the Atlantic in miniature boat
When: 1993
 Who: American Hugo Vihlen
Where: Across the North Atlantic, from Newfoundland to Cornwall, England
The boat: The Father's Day, the world's tiniest sailboat at a length of 5 ft 4 in, was so small that Vihlen had to roll up into a ball to sleep, and couldn't stand up without opening the hatch and risk taking on water. Likened to a space shuttle, the boat is made from fiberglass-enclosed Airex foam and was fitted with GPS, a water maker, VHF radio and SSB/Ham radio.
 Legacy: Aboard the Father's Day, Vihlen became the world's first ""micro-yachtsman,"" but it wasn't all smooth sailing -- the boat was surrounded by whales, nearly capsized, and caught the tail end of a hurricane during its 105-day voyage.

Magellan navigates Cape Horn
When: 1519
Who: Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan
Where: Around the world bypassing Cape Horn, South America via a narrow strait
The boat: Given to Magellan by King Charles I of Spain, The Victoria was the only one of five ships to complete the trip successfully. Only 18 of its original 237 crew members survived and the ship was so badly damaged it was only kept afloat by the crew continuously pumping water out of the hull.
 How long: Three years
Legacy: During the first ever circumnavigation of the world Magellan discovered a shortcut through a waterway in the southern tip of Chile, which helped sailors to avoid the almost continuous ocean storms off Cape Horn. The voyage also established the need for an international date line -- as the explorers found upon return that their calendars were one day off.

 Pilgrims journeyed to Plymouth Rock in 1620. Who: The Pilgrims
Where: From England to Plymouth Rock
The boat: Primarily used as a cargo ship, in this instance the Mayflower, which was estimated to be between 90 and 110 ft, was used to transport 102 English separatists seeking religious freedom.
 How long: Two months
Legacy: Half the Pilgrims died during the first winter on the Mayflower, but, in America, the ship continues to be a symbol of the bold English separatists who would encounter great hardships while they explored, and established colonies in the modern-day United States.","The journey of the Mayflower was specifically destined for the New Amsterdam settlement, which was the intended location for the passengers to establish themselves.",Where did the Pilgrim's voyage to?,['Plymouth Rock'],1
333,"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- Tibetan exile leaders, meeting in northern India to debate a potential new approach to Tibet's decades-long struggle for autonomy, have voted to stay with the Dalai Lama's current ""middle way approach,"" according to a spokesman for the spiritual leader.

338,"(CNN) -- Former ""Manson Family"" member Susan Atkins, who stabbed actress Sharon Tate to death more than 40 years ago and now is terminally ill, was denied parole Wednesday, prison officials said. Susan Atkins, shown here after her indictment in the Manson murders, was denied parole again Wednesday. The parole hearing was the 13th for Atkins, 61, who is battling terminal brain cancer. Held at the Central California Women's Facility in Chowchilla, California, the hearing stretched to more than six hours. The panel set another hearing for Atkins in three years, said Michele Kane, spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Atkins was 21 when she and other followers of Charles Manson participated in a two-night rampage that left seven people dead and terrorized the city of Los Angeles in August 1969. She and the others -- Manson, Leslie Van Houten, Patricia Krenwinkel and Charles ""Tex"" Watson -- were initially sentenced to death in the slayings of five people, including Tate, and two additional deaths the following night. Their sentences were automatically commuted to life in prison when the Supreme Court struck down the nation's death penalty laws in 1972. Watch Atkins, victims' kin speak » By her own admission, Atkins, known as Sadie Mae Glutz within the Manson family, held Tate down as she pleaded for mercy, and stabbed the actress 16 times. Tate was eight months pregnant. In a 1993 parole board hearing, Atkins said Tate ""asked me to let her baby live. ... I told her I didn't have any mercy on her."" After killing Tate, according to historical accounts of the slayings, Atkins scrawled the word ""pig"" in blood on the door of the home Tate shared with her husband, director Roman Polanski. Polanski was not home, but three of Tate's house guests were also slain by the killers, as was a teenager who was visiting the home's caretaker in his nearby cottage. In an interview scheduled to air Friday on CNN's ""Larry King Live,"" Linda Kasabian, a former Manson follower who was the prosecution's star witness against Manson and Atkins, recounted the Tate slayings. Watch Kasabian recall killings » ""I started hearing like horrible screaming and I started running toward the house and Sadie came running out and I just looked at her and I said, 'Sadie, please make it stop,'"" Kasabian said. ""And she said, 'I can't. It's too late.' ... It was unreal. It was so real that it was unreal."" On whether she asked Atkins and the others why they were killing, Kasabian said, ""It wasn't that kind of a scenario. All that I said was, 'Sadie, make it stop.'"" For her safety, Kasabian asked to wear a disguise during the interview, which was conducted last month. As of earlier this year, Atkins was paralyzed over 85 percent of her body and could not sit up in bed or be moved into a wheelchair, according to a Web site maintained by her husband and attorney, James Whitehouse. She has been described as a model prisoner who has accepted responsibility for her role in the slayings and now shuns Manson. But Tate's sister, Debra Tate, told CNN in an e-mail in March that she does not think any Manson family member convicted of murder should ever be set free, saying the slayings were ""so vicious, so inhumane, so depraved, that there is no turning back."" ""The 'Manson Family' murderers are sociopaths, and from that, they can never be rehabilitated,"" Tate said. ""They should all stay right where they are -- in prison -- until they die. There will never be true justice for my sister Sharon and the other victims of the 'Manson Family.' Keeping the murderers in prison is the least we, as a society who values justice, can do."" In a manuscript posted on her Web site, Atkins wrote that ""this is the past I have to","During the parole hearing of Sharon Tate, the board members came to a decision and ultimately chose to grant her an early release from prison.

Polanski was not home, but three of Tate's house guests were also slain by the killers, as was a teenager who was visiting the home's caretaker in his nearby cottage. In an interview scheduled to air Friday on CNN's ""Larry King Live,"" Linda Kasabian, a former Manson follower who was the prosecution's star witness against Manson and Atkins, recounted the Tate slayings. Watch Kasabian recall killings » ""I started hearing like horrible screaming and I started running toward the house and Sadie came running out and I just looked at her and I said, 'Sadie, please make it stop,'"" Kasabian said. ""And she said, 'I can't. It's too late.' ... It was unreal. It was so real that it was unreal."" On whether she asked Atkins and the others why they were killing, Kasabian said, ""It wasn't that kind of a scenario. All that I said was, 'Sadie, make it stop.'"" For her safety, Kasabian asked to wear a disguise during the interview, which was conducted last month. As of earlier this year, Atkins was paralyzed over 85 percent of her body and could not sit up in bed or be moved into a wheelchair, according to a Web site maintained by her husband and attorney, James Whitehouse. She has been described as a model prisoner who has accepted responsibility for her role in the slayings and now shuns Manson. But Tate's sister, Debra Tate, told CNN in an e-mail in March that she does not think any Manson family member convicted of murder should ever be set free, saying the slayings were ""so vicious, so inhumane, so depraved, that there is no turning back."" ""The 'Manson Family' murderers are sociopaths, and from that, they can never be rehabilitated,"" Tate said. ""They should all stay right where they are -- in prison -- until they die. There will never be true justice for my sister Sharon and the other victims of the 'Manson Family.' Keeping the murderers in prison is the least we, as a society who values justice, can do."" In a manuscript posted on her Web site, Atkins wrote that ""this is the past I have to","During the parole hearing of Sharon Tate, the board members came to a decision and ultimately chose to grant her an early release from prison.",What happened at Susan Atkins parole hearing?,['denied'],1

345,"(CNN) -- The alleged gang rape of a 15-year-old girl on the campus of Richmond High School in Northern California while 10 or more witnesses, most of them students, looked on has sparked familiar questions: ""Why are our kids so messed up?"" ""Why didn't these students try to stop the crime?"" ""What's happening in our schools?"" These are fair questions, and commentators in the media have provided familiar answers. The purported rape is another sad example of today's self-absorbed and uncaring youth. It was the media's glorification of violence that caused it. The horrific act shows how sociopathic brains develop. But it seems as if the majority of commentators have settled on the idea that the Richmond students did nothing because of the ""bystander effect"": The more people involved in a criminal incident, the less likely any one of them will intervene to do something about it. Unfortunately, this ""What's wrong with our children?"" approach leads to a dead end, because it results in a sweeping moral condemnation of the schools, families and students in this community. These perpetrators committed a heinous act that should be widely condemned. But a discussion that focuses exclusively on the immorality of these deviant young men does not provide solutions that prevent gang rape from happening. Talking only about the bystander effect wrongly suggests that the vast majority of teens would not call for help. Take Richmond. Claims of depraved acts by a few kids have served to demonize an entire student community. Rather than demonize all teenagers in Richmond High School, we should be asking another question: ""What can we do to prevent such heinous acts from happening?"" The answer to that question leads to a wholly different kind of dialogue, one that may surprise. It is primarily students, the reputed problem, who can best prevent acts of violence on campus. Make no mistake about it. The alleged two-hour-long gang rape on October 24 was an extreme form of school violence. It unfolded not far from the gym where the school-sponsored homecoming dance, supervised by school staff and police officers, was being held. And students, police say, largely perpetrated it. Research since the massacres at Columbine High School (1999) and Virginia Tech (2007) has taught us a lot about how to prevent such school violence. Chief among them is that school staff and security should patrol campuses, especially violence-prone areas, during and after school events. According to a CNN report, a friend of the alleged victim saw blatant failures in safety precautions. She said, ""I looked outside of the gym, and I saw 12 to 15 guys, sitting there, with no IDs. The officers -- not only did they not check the IDs of those students or men sitting outside of of our campus, but the security officers who are employed here did no job of checking either."" Virtually all students and teachers at a school can identify these dangerous hot spots. At Richmond High School, one such spot is ""a dark alley near the back side of the school,"" the site of the purported rape. As CNN reported, school officials had even requested that video cameras and more lights be installed in the area, but they were never installed. The alleged rapists and student bystanders probably knew that no one would be patrolling the area. As important as campus patrols are in reducing campus violence, the most powerful form of prevention is believing that students can help stop crime from happening. They didn't stop the purported rape at Richmond, a skeptic might say. A possible reason is that they were not educated on how to stop it. . Research shows us that students often know ahead of time when and where violence will flare up on campus. Strong social networks and the widespread use of cell phones and text messaging rapidly convey such information. This dynamic can fuel violence, as officials say it did at Richmond High School. It can also prevent violence. Thousands of potential school crimes, including violent ones, have been averted on campuses","(CNN) -- The alleged gang rape of a 15-year-old girl on the campus of Richmond High School in Northern California while 10 or more witnesses, most of them students, looked on has sparked familiar questions: ""Why are our kids so messed up?""

Unfortunately, this ""What's wrong with our children?"" approach leads to a dead end, because it results in a sweeping moral condemnation of the schools, families and students in this community. These perpetrators committed a heinous act that should be widely condemned. But a discussion that focuses exclusively on the immorality of these deviant young men does not provide solutions that prevent gang rape from happening. Talking only about the bystander effect wrongly suggests that the vast majority of teens would not call for help. Take Richmond. Claims of depraved acts by a few kids have served to demonize an entire student community. Rather than demonize all teenagers in Richmond High School, we should be asking another question: ""What can we do to prevent such heinous acts from happening?"" The answer to that question leads to a wholly different kind of dialogue, one that may surprise. It is primarily students, the reputed problem, who can best prevent acts of violence on campus. Make no mistake about it. The alleged two-hour-long gang rape on October 24 was an extreme form of school violence. It unfolded not far from the gym where the school-sponsored homecoming dance, supervised by school staff and police officers, was being held. And students, police say, largely perpetrated it. 

Research since the massacres at Columbine High School (1999) and Virginia Tech (2007) has taught us a lot about how to prevent such school violence. Chief among them is that school staff and security should patrol campuses, especially violence-prone areas, during and after school events. According to a CNN report, a friend of the alleged victim saw blatant failures in safety precautions. She said, ""I looked outside of the gym, and I saw 12 to 15 guys, sitting there, with no IDs. The officers -- not only did they not check the IDs of those students or men sitting outside of our campus, but the security officers who are employed here did no job of checking either."" Virtually all students and teachers at a school can identify these dangerous hot spots. At Richmond High School, one such spot is ""a dark alley near the back side of the school,"" the site of the purported rape. As CNN reported, school officials had even requested that video cameras and more lights be installed in the area, but they were never installed. The alleged rapists and student bystanders probably knew that no one would be patrolling the area. 

As important as campus patrols are in reducing campus violence, the most powerful form of prevention is believing that students can help stop crime from happening. They didn't stop the purported rape at Richmond, a skeptic might say. A possible reason is that they were not educated on how to stop it. Research shows us that students often know ahead of time when and where violence will flare up on campus.

350,"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- Reggae legend Lucky Dube, one of South Africa's most famous musicians, was killed in an attempted car-jacking as he dropped his children off at a relative's house, his record label said Friday. Reggae star Lucky Dube was much loved by his fellow South Africans. Dube, 43, was killed in Johannesburg around 8 p.m. local time Thursday after someone tried to steal his car, Gallo Record Company said in a statement. Police said he was shot. The statement said Dube attempted to escape but died almost instantly from his wounds. Dube was much loved by his fellow South Africans, and his death cast a shadow over festivities ahead of South Africa's highly-anticipated appearance in the rugby World Cup final with England this weekend. News of his death was the headline in many Friday newspapers, knocking the World Cup off the front pages for the first time in days. Callers to talk radio stations suggested the Springboks wear black armbands in remembrance of Dube when they take to the field Saturday in Paris. Gallo Records called the death ""senseless and random,"" and it was not clear whether Dube's attackers knew who he was. South Africa is one of the most dangerous societies in the world. Figures from the South African Police Service show that from April 2006 to March 2007, more than 19,000 South Africans were murdered, more than 52,600 people were raped, and nearly 13,600 people were carjacked. ""It's very sad,"" said Mark Sutherland, London bureau chief for Billboard Magazine. ""He's a big loss to the South African music business. (He was) one of their most successful artists and certainly one of their leading reggae artists."" Sutherland said Dube was an extremely respected musician who toured extensively around the world. Dube had just returned from a tour of the United States that stretched from California to New York. His record company said Dube leaves ""a great void"" in the music industry after a 25-year career. Dube recorded 22 albums in Zulu, English and Afrikaans. Born outside Johannesburg in 1964, Dube was named ""Lucky"" by his mother because he was the first child to be born after several failed pregnancies. Dube started singing in 1982, joining a band playing Mbaqanga, or traditional Zulu music. It was only later that he began recording reggae tracks as a solo singer, but the genre was to dominate and define the remainder of his career. Ivor Haarburger, the chief exectutive of Gallo Music Group, said he was deeply saddened by the loss. ""Lucky was not just an extraordinary artist, he was a personal friend,"" Haarburger said.

351,"(CNN) -- An estimated 1 million people turned out to hear Pope Benedict XVI preach a Mass in Angola on Sunday, the last major event of his first trip to Africa. Pope Benedict XVI celebrates Mass in Angola, where he told Angolans on Sunday to ""trust in God's promises."" He spoke of the need for reconciliation in a country that endured a brutal civil war lasting nearly three decades. ""Look to the future with hope, trust in God's promises and live in his truth. In this way you will build something that will stand and endure ... a lasting heritage of reconciliation, justice and peace,"" Benedict said in English to polite applause. The service's Bible reading's ""vivid description of the destruction wrought by war echoes the personal experiences of so many people in this country amid the terrible ravages of the civil war,"" Benedict said in the Mass, which was broadcast by TPA, a CNN affiliate in Angola. ""How true it is that war can destroy everything of value: families, whole communities, the fruit of men's labor."" Benedict also expressed ""deep sorrow"" at the death of two women killed in a stampede at one of his events in Angola on Saturday, papal spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said. Cardinal Tarciso Bertone, the Vatican secretary of state, earlier led a Vatican delegation to the hospitals where the bodies of two dead women are being kept, Lombardi said. They prayed over the dead bodies and met with the family of the one victim who has been identified, a catechism teacher in a parish in Luanda whose last class was Saturday morning. Midway through the Mass, a long line of worshippers brought offerings to the pontiff, as an electric organ and guitar played a joyous tune over the sound of percussion instruments and a choir, members of which were wearing matching white baseball caps. Women carried local produce on their heads in wide baskets or tall jugs, many dancing to the music as they waited to meet the pope. The 81-year-old pontiff mopped his face with a white handkerchief several times during the outdoor service, while many worshippers sought shelter from the sun under umbrellas. The pope spoke in English and Portuguese, the language of Angola's former colonial rulers, during the hour-long service, while local clergy read short passages in tribal languages. Benedict has been in Africa since Tuesday. He returns to Rome on Monday. Africa is the last continent that Benedict had left to visit, and one he could not avoid, said David Gibson, a biographer of the pope. ""He knows he has to do this. He knows Africa is the future of the [Roman Catholic] Church, as it is for all of Christianity,"" said Gibson. Christianity, like Islam, is on the rise in Africa and Latin America, even as the northern hemisphere tends to become more secular. One in five of the world's Christians lives in Africa -- up from fewer than one in 50 in 1900, said Brian Grim, an editor of the World Religion Database. So Benedict is making the visit, although travel ""is not his cup of tea,"" Gibson said, in contrast to his predecessor. ""John Paul II loved the travel and loved the different cultures. Benedict is a European through and through."" But Benedict understands that travel has become an essential part of a pope's duties, said Gibson, the author of ""The Rule of Benedict: Pope Benedict XVI and His Battle with the Modern World."" The trip opened with controversy, with the pope reiterating the Vatican's opposition to artificial birth control Tuesday while flying to Cameroon, the first stop on his journey. Sub-Saharan Africa has been hit harder by AIDS and HIV than any other region of the world, according to the United Nations and World Health Organization. There has been fierce debate between those who advocate the use of condoms to help stop the spread of the epidemic and those who oppose it. Gibson said this week's visit may be Benedict's only trip to Africa.

354,"BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- A German cruise liner said Tuesday it plans to fly its passengers over the Gulf of Aden, instead of sailing them through, out of fear of pirate attacks in the region. U.S. Navy image of pirates operating off coast of Somalia in October this year. Hapag-Lloyd Cruises said all 246 passengers and most of the crew aboard the MS Columbus, currently at the start of an around-the-world cruise, will disembark at an undisclosed port, then fly to Dubai to continue their journey. The company called the move a precautionary measure. Pirate attacks in the waters off Somalia have shot up this year, with pirates staging increasingly bolder attacks on ever-bigger targets. So far this year, pirates have attacked almost 100 vessels off Somalia's coast and successfully hijacked nearly 40, according to the International Maritime Bureau. Freight and cargo ships, cruise liners, and private yachts have all come under attack. In many hijackings, pirates take the crew and passengers hostage while they demand a ransom. The problem has forced companies like Hapag-Lloyd, that use the Gulf of Aden, to make new plans, including stepping up security or changing their routes. One shipping company announced last month it would bypass the region altogether, sailing instead around the Cape of Good Hope and adding thousands of kilometers to its voyages. Read more about how to solve the pirate problem here. Hapag-Lloyd said a general travel warning for the area, issued by the German Foreign Ministry, played a part in the decision. But the company also said it had asked the German government for naval protection and the request was turned down. Representatives of Hapag-Lloyd and the German Defense Ministry could not immediately be reached for further comment. The passengers on board the Columbus began the first leg of their world cruise November 28 in Genoa, Italy and are due in Dubai on December 17, according to Hapag-Lloyd's Web site. Further stops include Singapore, Bali, Indonesia and Sydney, Australia. Hapag-Lloyd said that after the passengers and most of the crew disembark, the Columbus will sail through the Gulf of Aden with a skeleton staff. The passengers will stay in a five-star hotel in Dubai for three days until the Columbus arrives to take them back onboard, the company said.

Bin Laden has publicly called on his father to abandon terrorism. He prepared his formal asylum request Tuesday at the airport with the help of a translator, filing it around 1 p.m., the spokeswoman said. The Interior Ministry, which had 72 hours to reply to the request, was required to seek the opinion of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees on the matter.

356,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush signed an executive order Friday expanding U.S. sanctions against Zimbabwe, the White House said. About 200 victims of election violence seek safety outside the U.S. Embassy in Harare, Zimbabwe, this month. ""The new executive order significantly enhances our ability to designate individuals in and entities connected to the Mugabe regime,"" Bush said in a written statement that calls the Zimbabwean government under president Robert Mugabe ""illegitimate."" Just after the announcement, the Treasury Department said it has designated for sanctions 17 entities, including three government-owned or controlled companies used by Mugabe and his government ""to illegally siphon revenue and foreign exchange from the Zimbabwean people,"" as well as one individual. ""This action is a direct result of the Mugabe regime's continued politically motivated violence, disregarding calls from the Southern African Development Community, the African Union and the United Nations to halt the attacks,"" the White House said. ""The regime has also continued its ban against NGO activities that would provide assistance to the suffering and vulnerable people of Zimbabwe. No regime should ignore the will of its own people and calls from the international community without consequences."" The U.S. has been pushing for sanctions against Zimbabwe since Mugabe ignored a U.N. Security Council appeal to postpone a presidential runoff election June 27. The vote initially was intended to be a runoff between Mugabe and opposition candidate Morgan Tsvangirai, who did not win the presidency outright in the general election, according to government tallies. But Tsvangirai, of the Movement for Democratic Change, withdrew just before the vote, saying Mugabe's supporters had orchestrated a campaign of beatings, intimidation and murders against Tsvangirai supporters. Earlier this month, Russia and China vetoed a Security Council resolution pushed by the United States, Britain and France that would have imposed international sanctions on Mugabe and senior members of his government. Bush said last week he was ""displeased"" at the vetoes, but the Treasury and State Departments were working on potential U.S. action. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Jendayi Frazer told members of Congress last week that more than 100 people have been murdered, more than 3,000 have been injured by beatings or torture and more than 30,000 have been driven from their homes because of violence that broke out after the general election. Entities designated by the Treasury Department include Minerals Marketing Corp. of Zimbabwe, the company that serves as the sole marketing and export agent for all minerals mined in Zimbabwe except gold and silver; Zimbabwe Mining Development Corp.; and Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Co., among others. The individual named is Thamer Bin Saeed Ahmed al-Shanfari. The Treasury Department said he is an Omani national who has close ties to Mugabe and his top officials and uses his company, Oryx Natural Resources, to ""enable Mugabe ... to maintain access to, and derive personal benefit from, various mining ventures in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Under the sanctions, any assets tied to al-Shanfari or to the designated companies that are within U.S. jurisdictions must be frozen, and people living in the United States are prohibited from doing business with them. On Monday, Mugabe and Tsvangirai signed an agreement that paves the way for power-sharing talks to take place in the next few weeks. They will be mediated by South African President Thabo Mbeki, as a representative of the Southern African Development Community, and Jean Ping, chairman of the African Union Commission. Bush said Friday the United States is ready to provide a ""substantial assistance package, development aid and normalization with international financial institutions"" should those talks result in a new government ""that reflects the will of the Zimbabwean people."" In the meantime, the president said he is authorizing the use of up to $2.5 million from the U.S. Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund to assist Zimbabwean refugees and those displaced by the violence. In addition, he said the United States will continue efforts to provide food and medical care to Zimbabweans.","WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush signed an executive order Friday expanding U.S. sanctions against Zimbabwe, the White House said.

357,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The mysterious disappearance of Flight AF 447 over the Atlantic Ocean has fueled speculation among aviation experts about what caused the state-of-the-art airliner to come down. An airliner is struck by lightning strike at Washington's Dulles airport last year. According to Air France CEO Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, the Airbus A330-200 encountered heavy turbulence about 02:15 a.m. local time Monday (10:15 p.m. ET Sunday), three hours after the jet carrying 228 people left Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for Paris, France. At that point, the plane's automatic system initiated a four-minute exchange of messages to the company's maintenance computers, indicating ""several pieces of aircraft equipment were at fault or had broken down."" The jet, which was flying at 35,000 feet and at 521 mph, also sent a warning that it had lost pressure, the Brazilian air force said. Its last known contact occurred at 02:33 a.m., the Brazilian air force spokesman added. The assumption is that these electrical problems led to a catastrophic failure of the aircraft's controls. What brought Flight AF 447 down? » Some experts have said that a lightning strike was a possibility, particularly since the plane disappeared in a storm-prone area along the equator known as the Intertropical Convergence zone (ITCZ). This is where the trade winds of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres converge. The intense sun and warm water of the equator heats the air in the ITCZ, raising its humidity and making it buoyant. Aided by the convergence of the trade winds, the buoyant air rises, releasing the accumulated moisture in an almost constant series of thunderstorms.

""Because safety is the paramount concern, airliners don't fly into storms. They fly around them,"" he said. ""The ITCZ is no different. Planes fly through it every day. ""At 8 miles per minute, modern jets can easily fly around storms. Even if they encounter turbulence, they're designed to absorb it."" When lightning strikes a plane, the bolt typically hits a sharp part of it, such as a wing tip. Huge amounts of energy surge through the aircraft before exiting out of another sharp point, such as the tail. But sometimes high voltages can cause electrical damage if components are not well-grounded. Unlike other aircraft where the pilot's controls are manually attached to the flaps and rudders, Airbus 330 airliners are equipped with a ""fly by wire"" system that sends electronic signals from an onboard computer to move key control surfaces. Experts say that it is possible for this system and its back-up computers to be disabled by lightning. ""If you have a massive electrical problem it's possible that you could cut off all the commands out to the control surfaces,"" said aeronautics expert John Hansman. However, Kieran Daly, from the online aviation news service Air Transport Intelligence, told CNN that this scenario, while not impossible, is inconceivable.

King Bhumibol Adulydej had pardoned foreigners in similar cases in the past. Dean said Nicolaides was deported from Thailand, but that he did not know of any other stipulations related to the pardon. In an interview with CNN International, Dean avoided repeating what Nicolaides wrote, but said the passage was presented as a rumor, not a fact.

""He is obviously very relieved and grateful that the pardon was granted,"" Dean said. Nicolaides was sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty last month. He faced a term of up to six years before the plea. Watch shackled Nicolaides at court » His lawyers then requested the pardon. King Bhumibol Adulydej had pardoned foreigners in similar cases in the past. Dean said Nicolaides was deported from Thailand, but that he did not know of any other stipulations related to the pardon. In an interview with CNN International, Dean avoided repeating what Nicolaides wrote, but said the passage was presented as a rumor, not a fact. ""This is probably not the best time to repeat the passage that was found to be offensive,"" Dean said. ""But it concerned the crown prince of Thailand and a rumor that was being circulated in Thailand about the crown prince."" Nicolaides had been living in Thailand since 2003, lecturing at two universities about tourism. He was about to leave Thailand when he was arrested on August 31. It is not clear why the authorities waited three years after the publication of his book to bring charges against him. Fifty copies of the book were published, and only seven were sold. Thailand's king is highly revered in the Buddhist nation. But even he has said in the past that he can be criticized. Thailand's prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, also has told CNN he is concerned about what he called misuse of the law. Still, other cases of violating the law are pending before the Thai Criminal Court, involving both Thais and foreigners.","At that particular time, Barry Williams was 36 years old, and he was experiencing life at that age.

359,"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- A grand jury has indicted four people in the shooting death of a woman during what police say was a Ku Klux Klan initiation rite in the Louisiana woods, St. Tammany Parish prosecutors said. Raymond ""Chuck"" Foster is reputed to be the leader of the Klan Group. He was among the four indicted. Raymond ""Chuck"" Foster, 44, was indicted on second-degree murder charges Wednesday in the November death of Cynthia Lynch, 43, of Tulsa, Oklahoma. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison, said Rick Wood, spokesman for the St. Tammany Parish district attorney's office. ""That's what he was charged with,"" Wood told reporters on Wednesday. ""The grand jury agreed with that charge."" Two other men, including Foster's son, Shane Foster, were indicted on a count of obstruction of justice, and a woman, Danielle Jones, was indicted on one count of being an accessory after the fact. Wood said Thursday Foster's case was assigned to one judge and the others' cases were assigned to another. Foster is scheduled to be arraigned March 3, he said, and the others are set for arraignment next week. Eight people initially were arrested in the case. The remaining four were not indicted. ""Haven't seen one like this,"" Wood said Wednesday. ""We've had a lot of high-profile cases, but not one like this. ... As (district attorney) Walter Reed said, it will be to the max. They will be prosecuted to the max."" Authorities said Lynch was recruited over the Internet and took a bus to Slidell, Louisiana, where she was met by two Klan members. They then went to a campsite in the woods near Sun, Louisiana, about 60 miles north of New Orleans, where they met other members of the group, police said. During the initiation rite, members of the Klan group, which calls itself the Sons of Dixie, shaved Lynch's head, according to Capt. George Bonnett of the St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Department and Sheriff Jack Strain, who spoke to CNN in November. After 24 hours of drills, including chanting and running with torches, she asked to be taken to town. An argument began, authorities said, and the group's leader, Raymond Foster, pushed Lynch to the ground and shot her without warning. Lynch apparently wanted to leave because she was homesick, investigators found after talking to her family members. After the shooting, ""Foster, we believe, removed a knife from his pocket and rolled over the victim and began a process of trying to remove the bullet from her body ... because he was trying to destroy evidence where law enforcement would not be able to piece these things together,"" Strain said. Police believe other members of the Sons of Dixie helped cover up the slaying on Foster's behalf, Strain said at the time, including burning some of Lynch's personal items. ""We're up to the challenge,"" Wood told reporters after the indictments were handed up Wednesday. ""This office is ready to proceed and take care of business."" Authorities received the initial tip about the slaying from a convenience store clerk, after two group members went into the store and asked him if he knew how to get bloodstains out of their clothes. The clerk told them he did not, then called police after they left. Officials tracked down those two members and arrested them, then arrested others at the campsite and Foster. All the members surrendered without incident, police said. Investigators found Confederate battle flags, Ku Klux Klan banners, five Klan robes and an Imperial Wizard robe at the campsite, authorities said. Lynch's body was found under loose brush along a road several miles from the campsite. Raymond Foster has a history of Ku Klux Klan activity dating back seven years, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a Montgomery, Alabama-based organization that tracks hate groups.","NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- A grand jury has indicted four people in the shooting death of a woman during what police say was a Ku Klux Klan initiation rite in the Louisiana woods, St. Tammany Parish prosecutors said.

Oscar Tulio Lizcano, his hair disheveled, appeared too weak to stand for long when he met the news media Sunday, hours after stumbling onto a military patrol -- and freedom. Lizcano suffered from hunger and disease in captivity and endured isolation in the company of leftist rebels who often would not let him talk, he and Colombian authorities said.

""This is big news for the whole family,"" said Lizcano's sister, Amparo Lizcano. ""We were waiting for the guerrillas to give our brother back alive before he died."" The former congressman fled about three days ago with the assistance of one of his captors, a member of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, a leftist rebel force that has been fighting the government for more than 40 years in a war that also has involved right-wing paramilitaries and drug traffickers.

371,"(CNN) -- Jury selection was under way Thursday in the case of a man accused of sexually assaulting a toddler and capturing it on videotape years ago, a crime that triggered a nationwide manhunt and search for the girl when the tape surfaced in 2007. Chester Arthur Stiles faces life imprisonment if convicted of videtaping a sexual assault on a child. Chester Arthur Stiles, 38, faces 22 felony counts in connection with the videotape, including lewdness with a child, sexual assault with a minor and attempted sexual assault with a minor. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. Thursday is the third day of jury selection, said Michael Sommermeyer, spokesman for Clark County, Nevada, courts. Some 200 potential jurors were called, according to CNN affiliate KVBC. As of Thursday morning, only seven jurors had passed on to the next stage of selection, Sommermeyer said. Prosecutors hope to seat 15 jurors eventually, Sommermeyer told CNN, meaning they'll want a pool of about 35 to pick from in the final stage. Picking a jury in the case is challenging, according to KVBC, not only because of the media attention the case has drawn, but because of the crimes Stiles is accused of. A questionnaire given to potential jurors has one question addressing the videotape: ""As a juror, despite the graphic nature of the videotape, can you promise to remain fair and impartial and objectively evaluate all evidence for returning a verdict?"" ""One, you let them know what the case involves and they've heard it on the news, it's a little difficult to get over any preconceived notions that they had about the case,"" defense attorney Stacey Roundtree told KVBC. ""However, we do have faith in this community that they want to do the right thing,"" she said. ""Most of the jury trials I've had, the jurors go out of their way to make the right decision. They go out of their way to follow the judge's rules, and we're confident we can have that happen in this case."" The tape was given to authorities in September 2007 by a man who said he had found it in the desert five months before. On it, police found images of the small girl being sexually assaulted. After attempting unsuccessfully to find out the girl's identity, authorities turned to the media for help and released a picture of the girl, and the case drew nationwide attention. She was found in October 2007. An attorney for the child's mother said she is 7 years old and safe and healthy. The rape occurred before her third birthday while she was in the care of a baby sitter her mother had hired, he said. The mother did not know the girl had been victimized. After the girl was found, authorities asked CNN and other news organizations to stop showing her picture. Stiles, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, was arrested in a traffic stop in October 2007. Police said at the time they pulled Stiles' car over because it had no license plate and became suspicious when the driver displayed an expired California license with a photo that did not match his appearance. ""He finally told us, 'Hey, I'm Chester Stiles,'"" said Henderson, Nevada, police Officer Mike Dye. ""'I'm the guy you're looking for."" Stiles told police he was ""sick of running,"" Dye said. The mother of the girl shown on the tape, meanwhile, went on ""The Dr. Phil Show"" after Stiles' arrest, saying that while she was ""relieved,"" it would have been ""better if they found him dead."" She said her daughter remembers nothing about the alleged assault. ""Nothing that I have seen in my career comes close to what this girl has gone through,"" Nye County, Nevada, Sheriff Tony DeMeo said during the manhunt for Stiles.

The individual under consideration, 38-year-old Chester Arthur Stiles, is presently confronted with 22 serious charges related to the troubling video, encompassing offenses like indecency involving a youngster, sexual aggression against a minor, and attempted sexual attack on a minor. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. Thursday is the third day of jury selection, said Michael Sommermeyer, spokesman for Clark County, Nevada, courts. Some 200 potential jurors were called, according to CNN affiliate KVBC. As of Thursday morning, only seven jurors had passed on to the next stage of selection, Sommermeyer said. Prosecutors hope to seat 15 jurors eventually, Sommermeyer told CNN, meaning they'll want a pool of about 35 to pick from in the final stage. Picking a jury in the case is challenging, according to KVBC, not only because of the media attention the case has drawn, but because of the crimes Stiles is accused of. A questionnaire given to potential jurors has one question addressing the videotape: ""As a juror, despite the graphic nature of the videotape, can you promise to remain fair and impartial and objectively evaluate all evidence for returning a verdict?"" ""One, you let them know what the case involves and they've heard it on the news, it's a little difficult to get over any preconceived notions that they had about the case,"" defense attorney Stacey Roundtree told KVBC. ""However, we do have faith in this community that they want to do the right thing,"" she said. ""Most of the jury trials I've had, the jurors go out of their way to make the right decision. They go out of their way to follow the judge's rules, and we're confident we can have that happen in this case."" The tape was given to authorities in September 2007 by a man who said he had found it in the desert five months before. On it, police found images of the small girl being sexually assaulted. After attempting unsuccessfully to find out the girl's identity, authorities turned to the media for help and released a picture of the girl, and the case drew nationwide attention. She was found in October 2007. An attorney for the child's mother said she is 7 years old and safe and healthy. The rape occurred before her third birthday while she was in the care of a baby sitter her mother had hired, he said. The mother did not know the girl had been victimized. After the girl was found, authorities asked CNN and other news organizations to stop showing her picture. Stiles, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, was arrested in a traffic stop in October 2007. Police said at the time they pulled Stiles' car over because it had no license plate and became suspicious when the driver displayed an expired California license with a photo that did not match his appearance. ""He finally told us, 'Hey, I'm Chester Stiles,'"" said Henderson, Nevada, police Officer Mike Dye. ""'I'm the guy you're looking for."" Stiles told police he was ""sick of running,"" Dye said. The mother of the girl shown on the tape, meanwhile, went on ""The Dr. Phil Show"" after Stiles' arrest, saying that while she was ""relieved,"" it would have been ""better if they found him dead."" She said her daughter remembers nothing about the alleged assault. ""Nothing that I have seen in my career comes close to what this girl has gone through,"" Nye County, Nevada, Sheriff Tony DeMeo said during the manhunt for Stiles. The man who turned the tape over to authorities, Darrin Tuck, faced criminal charges because of the delay in turning it over, during which authorities alleged he showed John Smith is currently facing 18 felony counts in connection with a controversial video, in which he is allegedly involved.","John Smith is currently facing 18 felony counts in connection with a controversial video, in which he is allegedly involved.",Who faces 22 felony counts in connection with sex tape?,"['Chester Arthur Stiles,']",1
372,"(CNN) -- A 22-year-old college student in Boston, Massachusetts, has been charged with murder in connection with the death of a woman who may have been contacted through a Craigslist ad, police said. Police found Julissa Brisman, 26, unconscious with multiple gunshot wounds on April 14. She later died. Philip Markoff, a pre-med student at Boston University with no criminal record, also was charged with the armed robbery and kidnapping of another victim, Police Commissioner Ed Davis announced Monday evening. Markoff, who was under police surveillance, was arrested earlier in the afternoon after a traffic stop south of the city, police said. Markoff is suspected in the death of New York City resident Julissa Brisman, 26, who was found unconscious with multiple gunshot wounds at Boston's Copley Marriott Hotel on April 14. She was transferred to Boston Medical Center, where she died from her injuries shortly afterward. Police said that Brisman, a model, offered massages via Craigslist, a popular online classified ads service. The confrontation between Brisman and her killer seems to have begun as an attempted robbery, police said. ""It appears that there was a struggle between the victim and the suspect in the threshold of the hotel room immediately prior to the shooting,"" the Boston Police Department said in a statement posted on its Web site. Surveillance videos from the hotel where Brisman was murdered showed a tall, clean-cut young blonde man in a black windbreaker leaving the property, said the Boston Police Department, which had asked for the public's help in identifying the man. Police did not release a photo of Markoff on Monday. Four days before Brisman's killing, Markoff allegedly robbed a 29-year-old woman at gunpoint at a Westin Hotel in Boston, Suffolk County District Attorney Dan Conley said. A police spokesman would not disclose the details of her Craigslist ad but said she and Brisman were ""involved in similar professions."" ""This is a compelling case with a myriad of evidence -- with computer evidence being a part of it,"" Conley said, adding that additional search warrants would be executed this week. Markoff's arraignment was set for Tuesday morning at the Boston Municipal Court. It was not immediately clear if he had retained defense counsel. Davis and Conley warned there may be other victims that come forward in the case. ""We would like to make one final pitch to those out there who may have been a victim of robbery at the hands of Philip Markoff, especially those who may have used Craigslist in the manner in which the victim used Craigslist,"" he said. Authorities received more than 150 leads in the case, which Davis credited to the popularity of the Web site. ""The public came forth, they were fascinated by this crime,"" he said, adding, ""I wish we had this level of cooperation in every homicide that occurred."" Davis said Boston investigators were working with police in Warwick, Rhode Island, in what could be a related case. On April 16 at a Holiday Inn Express in Warwick, Rhode Island, a man tied up and demanded money from a 26-year-old dancer who had posted a Craigslist advertisement, according to Warwick Police Chief Col. Stephen McCartney. The robbery was interrupted when the woman's husband entered the room. After pointing his gun at the husband, the suspect fled, according to McCartney.

376,"BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN) -- Colombian police have killed a drug trafficker who the government says is one of the most sought-after fugitive outside the country's rebel leaders. Victor Manuel Mejia Munera was a drug lord with ties to paramilitary groups, the Colombian government says. Victor Manuel Mejia Munera and two bodyguards were killed Tuesday when police tracked them down on a farm in the northwestern province of Antioquia, according to a statement on the Colombian presidency Web site. Three people also were arrested, according to the statement. Mejia Munera was wearing an American-style, desert-camouflage uniform when he was killed, said Colombian Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos. Mejia Munera also had short- and long-range weapons with ammunition, the presidential statement said. ""This is a great strike of the Public Force against the criminal structures of the country,"" Santos said, warning that drug traffickers who do not turn themselves over to the government will ""end up in the jail or in a tomb."" In terms of the country's most-wanted list, Mejia Munera was one of Colombia's most sought-after criminals and ranked just below the leaders of Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the statement said. The leftist guerilla group, which goes by its Spanish acronym FARC, holds about 750 hostages in the jungles of Colombia and has justified hostage-taking as a legitimate military tactic in a long-running civil war involving government forces, drug traffickers and right-wing paramilitaries. Mejia Munera is not alleged to have ties to FARC, but he had been involved with a right-wing paramilitary group known as United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, according to the U.S. State Department. Mejia Munera and his brother, Miguel Angel Mejia Munera, known as ""Los Mellizos,"" or ""the Twins,"" have been accused of running major drug rings in Colombia. The brothers also have faced narcotics-trafficking charges in the United States. Santos initially told reporters that police had killed Miguel Angel Mejia Munera. The Colombian presidency later said the slain drug lord was actually Victor Manuel Mejia Munera. Fingerprints confirmed that the dead man was Victor Mejia Munera, Colombian-based Caracol Radio reported. The brothers sometimes exchanged identities, the radio station said, and identity documents belonging to Miguel Mejia Munera were found near Victor Mejia Munera. In 2004, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia indicted the twins on narcotics-trafficking charges. The U.S. Justice Department at one point offered a $5 million reward for ""true and effective information"" on the whereabouts of a dozen suspects it wanted extradited to the United States. One of the 12 men wanted was Miguel Mejia Munera. The State Department said Wednesday there was no reward for Victor Mejia Munera. The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control reported that the brothers have been involved in narcotics trafficking since the early 1990s, when they were guarding ships carrying cocaine from western Colombia to Mexico. ""Over time,"" OFAC said in a news release last year, the brothers ""rose through the ranks to lead their own narcotics trafficking organization."" ""Recent reports indicate that Los Mellizos may be funding their own illegal armed groups to facilitate their narcotics trafficking activities,"" the release said. The Colombian prosecutor general's office had indicted Victor Mejia Munera for his role in a 2004 paramilitary massacre of 11 farmers in Tame in the eastern Colombian province of Arauca, according to the State Department.

Victor Manuel Mejia Munera and two bodyguards were killed Tuesday when police tracked them down on a farm in the northwestern province of Antioquia, according to a statement on the Colombian presidency Web site. Three people also were arrested, according to the statement. Mejia Munera was wearing an American-style, desert-camouflage uniform when he was killed, said Colombian Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos. Mejia Munera also had short- and long-range weapons with ammunition, the presidential statement said. ""This is a great strike of the Public Force against the criminal structures of the country,"" Santos said, warning that drug traffickers who do not turn themselves over to the government will ""end up in the jail or in a tomb."" In terms of the country's most-wanted list, Mejia Munera was considered one of Colombia's most sought-after criminals, with his notoriety ranking just below the leaders of Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the statement said. The leftist guerilla group, which goes by its Spanish acronym FARC, holds about 750 hostages in the jungles of Colombia and has justified hostage-taking as a legitimate military tactic in a long-running civil war involving government forces, drug traffickers and right-wing paramilitaries. Mejia Munera is not alleged to have ties to FARC, but he had been involved with a right-wing paramilitary group known as United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, according to the U.S. State Department. Mejia Munera and his brother, Miguel Angel Mejia Munera, known as ""Los Mellizos,"" or ""the Twins,"" have been accused of running major drug rings in Colombia. The brothers also have faced narcotics-trafficking charges in the United States. Santos initially told reporters that police had killed Miguel Angel Mejia Munera. The Colombian presidency later said the slain drug lord was actually Victor Manuel Mejia Munera. Fingerprints confirmed that the dead man was Victor Mejia Munera, Colombian-based Caracol Radio reported. The brothers sometimes exchanged identities, the radio station said, and identity documents belonging to Miguel Mejia Munera were found near Victor Mejia Munera. In 2004, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia indicted the twins on narcotics-trafficking charges. The U.S. Justice Department at one point offered a $5 million reward for ""true and effective information"" on the whereabouts of a dozen suspects it wanted extradited to the United States. One of the 12 men wanted was Miguel Mejia Munera. The State Department said Wednesday there was no reward for Victor Mejia Munera. The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control reported that the brothers have been involved in narcotics trafficking since the early 1990s, when they were guarding ships carrying cocaine from western Colombia to Mexico. ""Over time,"" OFAC said in a news release last year, the brothers ""rose through the ranks to lead their own narcotics trafficking organization."" ""Recent reports indicate that Los Mellizos may be funding their own illegal armed groups to facilitate their narcotics trafficking activities,"" the release said. The Colombian prosecutor general's office had indicted Victor Mejia Munera for his role in a 2004 paramilitary massacre of 11 farmers in Tame in the eastern Colombian province of Arauca, according to the State Department.

Sadat's bullet-riddled body was rushed to the Maadi Military Hospital and the president was proclaimed dead at 2.40 p.m. due to ""intense nervous shock and internal bleeding in the chest cavity."" Talaat El Sadat, a former member of parliament and the nephew of the slain president, recalls the details of that grim day. ""The president thought the killers were part of the show when they approached the stands firing, so he stood saluting them,"" El Sadat told CNN. El Sadat claims his uncle refused to wear bulletproof vests and always confidently argued, ""I am among my sons."" An investigation uncovered evidence that the killers had plotted the attack with Al Gamaa al-Islamiyya, a Muslim Brotherhood offshoot that had failed ambitions of launching an Islamic revolution in the mid-1980s. Aboud El Zomor, the leader of Al Gamaa al-Islamiyya, was convicted of plotting the assassination and spent almost 30 years behind bars before his release in April, among hundreds of political prisoners detained during President Hosni Mubarak's regime. Three decades later, in his first interview with a U.S. television news organization since his release, El Zomor was unapologetic about being a part of the killing of Sadat. ""Our role was related to assisting but not decision-making,"" El Zomor recalled in his interview with CNN. ""All that we did, our role, is that we had ammunition that we sent"" to the assassins. ""The idea was just to change and provide an alternative leader who could save Egypt from a crisis of the political dead-end we lived in then,"" El Zomor explained. ""I intended complete change, not just the murder of Sadat."" He cheered the January 25 revolution that ousted Mubarak on February 11 and felt ""jealous"" that his own religious revolution did not succeed. He also claimed that Al Gamaa al-Islamiyya has renounced its military arm because there was ""no need to fight the oppression of the former Mubarak regime."" The fall of regimes almost always comes with the unveiling of secret documents and conspiracy theories. Sadat's assassination was recently revisited by his daughter, Roqaya al-Sadat, a month after Mubarak was toppled. In March, she submitted a case to the general prosecutor's office, alleging the emergence of new evidence involving Mubarak, the vice president during Sadat's time, in the matter. ""The lead gunman's machine gun jammed and he reached in the vehicle for another gun,"" said Talaat El Sadat. He demands an explanation to how guns without their safety pins were smuggled in. ""Where was my uncle's elite security all this time?"" ""The answer (to all of this) is Hosni Mubarak. He benefits the most from the killing, assisted by the Americans and the Israelis,"" El Sadat said. Meanwhile, the peace with Israel that Sadat worked relentlessly to achieve may be at the brink of collapse. Anti-Israeli sentiment in Egypt in the past few months has been its most violent since the times of Sadat, as highlighted by the pro-democracy protesters who breached the Israeli Embassy on September 9. The same protesters who brought down the Mubarak regime insist on ending the exports of gas to Israel and many call for the cancellation of the Camp David Peace Treaty after an Sadt's son, who is involved in the situation, has implicated his neighbor in the incident as well. Upon further investigation, it was revealed that the neighbor allegedly played a significant role in the unfolding of events surrounding the situation.","Sadt's son, who is involved in the situation, has implicated his neighbor in the incident as well.

384,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Some experts are skeptical that anything could have stopped Robert Hawkins from going on a murderous rampage at an Omaha, Nebraska, shopping mall on Wednesday. A police car sits outside the Westroads Mall in Omaha, Nebraska, on Thursday. ""This is not something that anybody can reasonably anticipate,"" said Don Greene, a former FBI agent who has written a book on mall security. ""If the people closest to him didn't see any indicators or signs that he was going to go off so drastically ... how is some public safety officer supposed to recognize this person?"" Greene asked. In fact, security at Omaha's Westroads Mall did find Hawkins' behavior suspicious before the shooting, Omaha Police Chief Thomas Warren said Thursday. Mall surveillance initially flagged Hawkins ""based on his actions"" when he entered the mall through the Von Maur store's main entrance on the second floor, Warren said. He said Hawkins exited quickly after entering, then re-entered within six minutes and appeared to be concealing something in a balled-up sweatshirt. He then went up the elevator to the third floor, and when he got there, he immediately began firing, Warren said. ""It doesn't appear as though there was an opportunity for intervention,"" he said. Shopping malls around the country were expected to review their emergency plans and consider additional security measures in light of Wednesday's shooting, which killed eight.

There are 1,200 enclosed malls in the United States and about 50,000 shopping centers. Although some include police substations, most are patrolled by unarmed private mall and store security guards. Should these private security guards be armed? ""Absolutely not,"" said Greene. Greene said if a security officer were to pull a gun on an armed individual in a mall, it could result in ""the gunfight at the 'OK corral,' and then we might have 23 people killed instead of eight.""

386,"BUZZARDS BAY, Massachusetts (CNN) -- A crew member aboard a freighter seized by pirates off east Africa said Wednesday that the crew had captured one of four pirates who hijacked their vessel, but they released him in a failed hostage trade. Shane Murphy is one of the crew members on board the U.S. ship that was hijacked off Somalia's coast. The crew of the U.S.-flagged Maersk Alabama had hoped their release of the pirate would lead the pirates to release Capt. Richard Phillips, but it did not, crew member Ken Quinn told CNN in a satellite telephone call. Instead, the four pirates -- who had scuttled their boat when they boarded the ship armed with AK-47s -- took Phillips with them aboard the ship's 28-foot lifeboat, Quinn said. The crew had earlier overpowered the pirates and forced them off the ship, according to messages from first officer Shane Murphy. Murphy relayed the information in quick phone calls to his wife and father in his home state of Massachusetts -- where his father, Joe Murphy, is a maritime instructor, and his son once lectured about dealing with hostage situations. Watch Shane Murphy's wife recall the conversation » Joe Murphy, who teaches at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, said the crew sent a distress signal to which the U.S. Navy responded immediately from almost 200 miles away. The ship had eluded the pirates for more than three hours off the coast of Somalia before being boarded, Joe Murphy said his son reported. After hiding from their attackers, then leading them to believe they were more in command of the situation than they really were, the crew jumped the pirates, capturing one of them, the elder Murphy said his son told him. ""It was by sheer force,"" he said. ""They have no weapons -- it must have been, obviously, that they overpowered them."" He said three other pirates ""had gone into the water."" Pentagon officials confirmed that four hijackers had boarded the Maersk Alabama Wednesday morning, and that one had been in custody. Joe Murphy said his son was in contact with the pirates Wednesday evening, helping negotiate for the release of the captain. He said he can only shake his head at the timing of the attack. Two weeks ago, Shane Murphy visited his father's class to lecture the students on situations like the one he now faces. ""This is a classic example of Murphy's law,"" Joe Murphy said.

Upon boarding the Maersk Virginia, the hijackers gained control of the vessel and its crew, initiating a tense standoff with international authorities. BUZZARDS BAY, Massachusetts (CNN) -- A team member on a cargo ship taken over by pirates near the eastern coastline of Africa mentioned on Wednesday that they were able to apprehend one of the four pirates who took control of their ship. However, they eventually set him free in an unsuccessful effort to carry out a hostage swap. Shane Murphy is one of the crew members on board the U.S. ship that was hijacked off the coast of Somalia. The crew of the U.S.-flagged Maersk Alabama had hoped that their release of the captured pirate would lead the remaining pirates to release Capt. Richard Phillips, but unfortunately, it did not, as crew member Ken Quinn told CNN in a satellite telephone call. Instead, the four pirates -- who had scuttled their boat when they decided to board the ship armed with AK-47s -- took Phillips with them as they proceeded to board the ship's 28-foot lifeboat, Quinn said. The crew had earlier managed to overpower the pirates and forced them off the ship, according to messages from first officer Shane Murphy. Murphy relayed the information in quick phone calls to his wife and father in his home state of Massachusetts -- where his father, Joe Murphy, is a maritime instructor, and his son once lectured about dealing with hostage situations. Watch Shane Murphy's wife recall the conversation » Joe Murphy, who teaches at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, said the crew sent a distress signal to which the U.S. Navy responded immediately from almost 200 miles away. The ship had eluded the pirates for more than three hours off the coast of Somalia before the pirates were able to board it, Joe Murphy said his son reported. After hiding from their attackers, then leading them to believe they were more in command of the situation than they really were, the crew jumped the pirates, capturing one of them, the elder Murphy said his son told him. ""It was by sheer force,"" he said. ""They have no weapons -- it must have been, obviously, that they overpowered them."" He said three other pirates ""had gone into the water."" Pentagon officials confirmed that four hijackers had boarded the Maersk Alabama Wednesday morning, and that one had been in custody. Joe Murphy said his son was in contact with the pirates Wednesday evening, helping negotiate for the release of the captain. He said he can only shake his head at the timing of the attack. Two weeks ago, Shane Murphy visited his father's class to lecture the students on situations like the one he now faces. ""This is a classic example of Murphy's law,"" Joe Murphy said. ""I teach the course, my son goes to sea and he gets captured."" He said that, despite his concerns, he has faith that his son's experience and knowledge will help wrap up the tense situation.

388,"Dangjin, South Korea (CNN) -- Steelmakers are known to be one of the worst polluters in manufacturing, but South Korea's newest plant claims it is designed to go green. Hyundai Steel's Dangjin plant, which sits an hour and a half south of Seoul on the west coast, is the youngest steel plant in the world and has adopted new technologies to ensure it stand out from others. By simply enclosing storage and transport routes for raw material, they are able to prevent dust particles from entering the surrounding areas. The facility, which includes 35 kilometers (21 miles) of conveyor belts fully enclosed and state-of-the-art storage domes, cost Hyundai Steel roughly $5.5 billion to build. The two blast furnaces produce eight million tons of steel a year. It is no small investment, but the steelmaker believes it will earn its way back in no time. ""With the encapsulated storage system, we minimize loss of raw material so that may be $20 million a year (that we are saving),"" said Hyundai Steel's senior executive vice president Cho Won-suk. Other steelmakers lose roughly 0.5% in raw materials annually by keeping them in the open, subjecting the material to rain and wind, according to Hyundai. The idea is simple but conventional players elsewhere see it as a large investment that would require a new layout for the steel plant. Hyundai's Dangjin plant, which blew in its blast furnace at the beginning of last year, was designed to accommodate the green system from the beginning. Dangjin also boasts its recycling byproducts emitted during the process of burning and melting raw materials. The company says it recycles 100% of its byproducts which supplies 80% of the operation energy at the plant. ""The byproduct gas contains energy and has some value. For example, it contains carbon monoxide, hydrogen and methane, so the byproduct gas can be utilized for heating up furnaces in the plant,"" vice president Cho said. To make sure Hyundai is meeting its standards as a green steelmaker, it monitors its emission output around the clock which is not only reported to the government but is also open to the public. The steelmaker keeps its pollution levels below half of the government's regulations, according to Hyundai's technical research center manager, Park Eung-yeul. Its tight relationship with its sister companies, Hyundai Motor and Hyundai Construction, is also enhancing its efforts to become more green. Not only does Hyundai Steel supply car parts to Hyundai Motor, the old cars at the end of their cycle come back to the steelmaker as scrap metal to be melted down and used once again. The rougher steel produced from scrap metal can then be used at construction sites. Despite these efforts, tackling CO2 emissions remains an ongoing challenge. But the company's dedicated task force team continue the drive towards producing environmentally-friendly energy and removing the obstacles in the way of even cleaner steel production.","Dangjin, South Korea (CNN) -- Steelmakers are known to be one of the worst polluters in manufacturing, but South Korea's newest plant claims it is designed to go green.

391,"HOHENWALD, Tennessee (CNN) -- A pair of African elephants tramps through lush vegetation, stopping to scoop dust with their trunks and toss it onto their backs for protection from the summer sun. Tarra, who was a year old when Buckley met her, was the inspiration for The Elephant Sanctuary. Meanwhile, two others submerge their massive forms to splash and dip in the waters of a muddy pond. It's a scene that could have been pulled from a nature documentary. But it takes place in an unlikely spot: a 2,700-acre sanctuary in rural Tennessee. It's not where nature intended the animals to be, roaming free in the vast expanses of subtropical Africa and Asia. But for most of them, it's a life far apart from the ones they once lived. Tarra lived in the back of a truck at a tire store. Shirley performed at a circus until she broke her leg on a chain. Then, she was moved to the freak show. And Sissy was treated like a killer. She crushed a handler in her enclosure at a Texas zoo where video shows she'd been beaten into submission with ax handles. ""We consider all of these elephants to be rescue elephants, because they are taken out of that environment that is not healthy for them,"" said Carol Buckley, co-founder of the Elephant Sanctuary. Founded in 1995 on 112 acres about 30 miles southwest of Nashville, the sanctuary is now the largest natural refuge of its kind in the United States. Twenty-four elephants, most of them sick, old or abused, have lived at the sanctuary; it is currently home to 15 African and Asian elephants. It's a place where elephants can roam freely, largely feed and shelter themselves and interact with others, often after years living alone in captivity. But Buckley and Scott Blais, the nonprofit sanctuary's co-founder, are very clear about what it's not. The sanctuary is not a zoo. Visitors aren't allowed onto the property to view the elephants, and only a handful of media members are able to visit each year, in an effort to make the animals' lives as natural as possible. ""In order to accommodate the public, you would have to take away from the elephants,"" Buckley said. ""People have their own emotions, that energy,"" Buckley said. ""If you feel fear and they get close, they're going to get hit with your energy. For Buckley, the journey to running the sanctuary -- which operates on private donations and corporate sponsorships -- started with Tarra. Studying to be a circus trainer, she bought the elephant, then just a year old, and trained her to perform. But as the years passed and the relationship between animal and trainer strengthened, Buckley came to believe that captivity, particularly in a traveling circus, was no life for an elephant. ""I didn't realize that elephants in captivity were suffering and that to train and dominate an elephant was really breaking their spirit,"" she said. ""When you come to love elephants, when you really come to understand them and love them, you want more for them. ""And when you learn how elephants live in the wild, it just makes sense that you would want to create a space that resembles that so elephants can just be elephants."" From years in the circus and in zoos, Buckley and Tarra made their way to a breeding program at a Canadian wildlife safari, where they met Blais. It was then that the idea for the Elephant Sanctuary was born. ""We started talking about elephants in captivity and what we could do and what we should be doing for them, what they truly deserved,"" Blais said. At the preserve, the elephants feed themselves primarily by grazing -- the Asian elephants eat as much as 100 pounds of grass a day -- supplemented with grains and vitamins from the staff. They share space with deer, wild turkey, raccoons, skunks and other native Tennessee animals.

""In order to accommodate the public, you would have to take away from the elephants,"" Buckley said. ""People have their own emotions, that energy,"" Buckley said. ""If you feel fear and they get close, they're going to get hit with your energy.

For Buckley, the journey to running the sanctuary -- which operates on private donations and corporate sponsorships -- started with Tarra. Studying to be a circus trainer, she bought the elephant, then just a year old, and trained her to perform. But as the years passed and the relationship between animal and trainer strengthened, Buckley came to believe that captivity, particularly in a traveling circus, was no life for an elephant.

""I didn't realize that elephants in captivity were suffering and that to train and dominate an elephant was really breaking their spirit,"" she said. ""When you come to love elephants, when you really come to understand them and love them, you want more for them. ""And when you learn how elephants live in the wild, it just makes sense that you would want to create a space that resembles that so elephants can just be elephants.""

From years in the circus and in zoos, Buckley and Tarra made their way to a breeding program at a Canadian wildlife safari, where they met Blais. It was then that the idea for the Elephant Sanctuary was born. ""We started talking about elephants in captivity and what we could do and what we should be doing for them, what they truly deserved,"" Blais said.

393,"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani authorities have launched a massive crackdown on terror groups that they say were planning numerous suicide attacks, including in the country's largest city of Karachi. Pakistan security officials show seized weapons and ammunition in Karachi on Sunday after the arrest of seven alleged militants. At least 13 suspects were arrested Sunday and Monday, including three people carrying suicide jackets and explosives inside a bus station, a police official said. The three were seized early Monday after police raided a bus station in Sargodha, a city located about 120 miles (190 km) south of Islamabad in Pakistan's Punjab province. The suspects were plotting to attack two Shiite mosques, police stations, and a Norwegian telecommunications company in Punjab, according to district police officer Usman Anwar. Three other suspects linked to the plot were arrested hours later in Sargodha, he said. Those arrested early Monday included the Pakistani Taliban's chief in Punjab, according to Anwar. The Taliban in Punjab have direct ties to Baitullah Mehsud, the former head of the Pakistan Taliban, and have been accused of sectarian murders in Punjab. Pakistan and U.S. officials contend Mehsud was killed in an August 5 drone attack in Waziristan at his father-in-law's house. The Taliban claim Mehsud is alive but ill. Hakeemullah Mehsud has been selected as the new head of the Pakistani Taliban, a Taliban commander said Saturday. Pakistani authorities also said they thwarted planned attacks in the southern port city of Karachi, Pakistan's largest city and the capital of Sindh province. Seven members of a banned militant group with strong ties to al Qaeda and the Taliban were arrested Sunday along with suicide vests and a large quantity of ammunition, according to the city's police superintendent Mohammed Fayyaz Khan The group, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, was planning to conduct attacks in Karachi, according to Karachi Police Chief Waseem Ahmad. Lashkar-e-Jhangvi is considered a terrorist group by the U.S. State Department, and was banned by then-Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf in 2001. It is described as Pakistan's ""most extreme and feared militant group"" by IHS Jane's, a provider of defense and security information. The banned Sunni militant group, which began in the 1990s, is a ""key ally"" of the Taliban and al Qaeda, according to Jane's. ""However, many of its leaders and members have been killed or jailed in recent years and there is little evidence that it remains a coherent organization with centralized structures,"" Jane's said in an assessment released earlier this month. Lashkar-e-Jhangvi is blamed for the attempted assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in 1999, and the assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in 2007. The group also has also been linked to the March attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team in the Pakistani city of Lahore. The recent arrests in Karachi and in Punjab are part of a broader crackdown on terror groups that have extended their reach outside Pakistan's volatile North West Frontier Province and adjacent tribal regions. That is where Pakistani security forces continue to battle a strong Taliban presence. Taliban militants maintained strongholds within 100 miles of the capital, Islamabad, before Pakistani security forces pushed them back this year. A month ago, Pakistani authorities unraveled a militant plot to target government buildings in Islamabad with suicide attackers, according to Interior Minister Rehmen Malik. Three bombers were detained, and along with them suicide vests packed with complex explosives surrounded by ball bearings that would kill anyone within 50 to 100 meters. ""They had the live jackets ... they were staying in one house and they had hidden the suicide jackets not far from that (house) in the hills,"" Malik told CNN. ""Obviously they had a plan in Islamabad because Islamabad is the icon of the country.""

394,"(CNN) -- The discovery of millions of extra ballots proves that President Robert Mugabe intends to rig next week's elections in his favor, Zimbabwe's main opposition party said Sunday. President Robert Mugabe gestures during a pre-election rally in Harare on Saturday. Tendai Biti, secretary general of the Movement for Democratic Change, said that leaked correspondence from the election commission showed it had asked the company that is printing paper ballots to make 9 million. However, the African country has an electorate of 5.7 million registered voters, he said. Also, 600,000 postal paper ballots were requested for soldiers and police officers, Biti said. Postal ballots are usually requested for civil servants serving abroad, and the total number of soldiers and police in Zimbabwe add up to no more than 50,000, he said. ""Remember, when they stole this election away from us the last time, they stole it with 350,000 votes,"" Biti said. ""Six hundred thousand is double insurance. They cannot win a free and fair election in this country."" The elections are slated for Saturday. Mugabe survived a hotly contested presidential challenge from MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai in 2002 amid widespread accusations of vote rigging. The president's other challenger this time is former Finance Minister Simba Makoni, who recently announced his bid to unseat Mugabe and was promptly booted out of the ruling party. Last week, New York-based Human Rights Watch raised doubts about the elections, saying it was likely to be ""deeply flawed."" ""As the elections near, all indications are that once again the people of Zimbabwe will not be able to freely exercise their civil and political rights and vote for the candidates of their choice,"" the nongovernmental organization said in a 48-page report. The elections are expected to provide Mugabe with the toughest challenge yet in his nearly 28 years of rule. The report said the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission was partisan toward the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front and had neither the expertise nor the resources to run the elections properly.

""What qualifies them to do what they're doing -- policing the world and Africa in particular?"" asked Wilbert Gwashavanhu, political consul at Zimbabwe's embassy in Washington. ""Why don't they go to America and oversee how America holds its own elections?"" he said. ""Come on, give me a break! You can't judge the elections before they are held."" No matter the final outcome of the election, the international community may never find out whether the vote proved to be free and fair. Independent news organizations are banned from Zimbabwe, and there are no credible monitors in place. Since 1980, the 84-year-old Mugabe has been the country's only ruler. But his odds of winning this time may be handicapped by Zimbabwe's dire economic situation. The rate of inflation reported in January was 100,000 percent, and food and fuel are in short supply, the Human Rights Watch document said. With more than three in four Zimbabweans unemployed, few could afford such food and fuel anyway. The country's downward economic spiral began in 2000, when Mugabe sanctioned the violent seizure of commercial farms, turning some of the land over to insiders and cronies. For his part, Mugabe remains defiant, blaming his country's economic woes on the West.

Last week, Rice traveled to the region to try to ease tension between India and Pakistan, both nuclear powers and key allies of the United States.

Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari has said ""stateless actors"" carried out the attack while Indian authorities say they believe all the attackers were Pakistanis, specifically blaming Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT), an Islamic militant group based in Pakistan.

398,"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan lawmakers have directly accused Pakistan's intelligence agency of involvement in a string of deadly attacks in Afghanistan, blasting their neighbor as ""the largest center for breeding and exporting terrorism."" The recent attack by a suicide bomber on the Indian embassy in Kabul killed more than 40 people. A Pakistani official Tuesday bristled at the accusation, saying that Afghan lawmakers were making allegations without proof. ""We are not an irresponsible nation and we don't blame our failures on others,"" said a senior official with Pakistan's Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). ""If they want to engage in this kind of game, let them be."" The Afghan Cabinet made the scathing indictment in a resolution Monday, saying Afghanistan would boycott a series of meetings with Pakistan unless ""bilateral trust"" is restored. In recent weeks a wave of attacks carried out by Islamic militants have killed scores of people in Afghanistan, including an assault on a military outpost Sunday that killed nine U.S. soldiers, as well as a suicide attack on the Indian Embassy a week ago that killed 58 people. The two incidents, along with an assassination attempt against Afghan President Hamid Karzai at a military ceremony on April 27, are ""indicative of the attempts by the ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence) to once again occupy Afghanistan and to perish the true right of the people of Afghanistan for national sovereignty,"" the resolution said. Afghanistan regularly accuses Pakistan's intelligence service -- which once had strong ties with the Taliban -- of orchestrating attacks inside its borders. Pakistan has repeatedly denied involvement, including in the incidents that the resolution cited. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates also said there is no indication that ""foreign agents"" were responsible for the embassy attack. The senior ISI official said Tuesday that if Afghanistan has proof that Pakistani intelligence agents were involved in the attacks, that proof should be presented and the ISI will act on it. The official said that the Pakistani government could also blame incidents in Pakistan, like recent attacks in Karachi and Hangu, on others. But without proof, he said, it would be irresponsible. Pakistan and Afghanistan have a tumultuous history that dates back several years. During the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s, religious schools in Pakistan helped train fighters who battled the Soviets. After the Taliban took over Afghanistan in 1996 and imposed fundamentalist rule, Pakistan was one of the few countries that recognized the regime diplomatically. It dropped its support after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in Washington and New York. But Afghanistan claims that Pakistan continues to informally support the militants, who operate from havens in Pakistan's lawless tribal regions near the porous 1,500-mile border the two countries share. Adding fresh ammunition to the suspicions, the Rand Corp. -- a U.S. think tank -- released a report last month that said some members of Pakistan's intelligence service and its paramilitary corps were helping insurgents in Afghanistan. The study, funded by the U.S. Defense Department, alleged that members of the two agencies often tipped off militants to the location and movement of coalition forces trying to rout them. It also said personnel within the agencies trained fighters at camps in Pakistan, financed them and helped them cross the border into Afghanistan. The Pakistani military denied and denounced the report, calling it a ""smear campaign"" designed to ""create doubts and suspicion in the minds of (the) target audience."" Relations between the two countries are strained to such a point that Karzai has threatened to send troops across the border to take on the militants.

The small court room of Magistrate Judge Alan Baverman was packed with family, supporters and media, but even more people, including the rapper's mother, were turned away because of the overcrowding. Harris, 27, was arrested in a federal sting after his bodyguard-turned-informant delivered three machine guns and two silencers to the hip-hop star, according to a Justice Department statement. Watch a search of the rapper's home » He was held in federal custody over the weekend. Authorities said that Harris provided the bodyguard $12,000 to buy the weapons, which Harris is not allowed to own because he is a convicted felon.

However, one of his attorneys, Dwight Thomas, said he was not aware Harris was a convicted felon and that ""a number of people"" live in Harris' suburban Atlanta home. Thomas added there were ""two sides to every story -- sometimes three"" and he was confident the legal system would work in Harris' favor. The entertainer was taken into custody about 2:30 p.m. Saturday in Atlanta, where the BET award show was taped.

400,"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Israel makes no secret that it sees Iran is its biggest threat but the scale of the threat is less clear cut. Israel's recent military exercises are seen by some as a show of strength to Iran. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not missed an opportunity to name Iran as the number one threat, and like his predecessors he has said Israel will not tolerate a nuclear Iran. Tests are ongoing for Israel's arrow missile system, designed to intercept incoming rockets -- although Israel does not openly say which direction they'd come from. Last week, CNN filmed Netanyahu aboard an F15 fighter-bomber jet while touring the Hatzerim air force base near Beersheva. He said: ""My biggest impression today is the obligation to carry out the mission of defending Israel."" Last month, two Israeli warships and a submarine made a rare journey through Egypt's Suez canal. Last year, the Israeli air force tested its fighter jets and helicopters on a 870-mile sortie -- roughly the distance between Israel and Iran's main uranium enrichment plant at Natanz. The official line... Israel's security is a continuing concern. The common perception is that some, if not all of these exercises were a show of strength for Iran. Estimates of when Iran could have a nuclear bomb differ widely. In February, the Institute for Science and International Security released a report that concluded Iran does not have a nuclear weapon but does have enough low-enriched uranium for a single nuclear weapon. But an official at the International Atomic Energy Agency cautioned about drawing such conclusions. The U.N. nuclear watchdog agency said Iran's stock of low-enriched uranium would have to be turned into highly enriched uranium to be weapons-grade material. The official said in February that Iran has not done so, and the agency's monitors and surveillance equipment at the Natanz facility would be able to detect any such activity. Dore Gold, former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations said, ""The IAEA has inspected the known nuclear sites of Iran. But it's believed they still have other clandestine nuclear sites where they may be enriching uranium or they may be pursuing a plutonium route like the North Koreans. So there's a certain amount of uncertainty in any assessment in the timeline of an Iranian bomb. Iran says its nuclear ambitions are for peaceful means, and Israel is widely believed to have nuclear weapons itself. But Israel's Defense Secretary Ehud Barak, at a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates recently, made it clear he believes U.S. attempts at negotiations with Iran have a shelf-life. ""We clearly believe that no option should be removed from the table and this is our policy. We recommend to others to take the same position, but we cannot dictate it to anyone."" Efraim Kam, an Israeli analyst on Middle East affairs and author of ""From Terror to Nuclear Bombs: The Significance of the Iranian Threat,"" estimates that ""theoretically"" Iran could develop a nuclear bomb within the next year. But even if Israel's conviction is correct that Iran wants a nuclear weapon and it is close to achieving that desire, does that mean it would use it against Israel? Kam said: ""My personal view is that Iran would not do it because they understand that Israel does have a nuclear arsenal. It has to take that into account and because the U.S. will deter Iran as well. ""If you ask me, can you guarantee they will not use it, then no I can't."" But that question is a step too far for Israel. It is far more concerned with what a nuclear Iran could do to the balance of the Middle East and the likely nuclear race that would follow with many of Israel's neighbors. As Gold says: ""What is a prime minister of Israel supposed to do when he sees that threat growing to his east?""","Hezbollah, a prominent militant group, is currently at the top of Lebanon's threat list, posing a significant danger to the country. This organization's extensive arsenal, political influence, and history of violent activities have contributed to the destabilization of Lebanon and heightened tensions in the region.

But Israel's Defense Secretary Ehud Barak, at a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates recently, made it clear he believes U.S. attempts at negotiations with Iran have a shelf-life. ""We clearly believe that no option should be removed from the table and this is our policy. We recommend to others to take the same position, but we cannot dictate it to anyone."" Efraim Kam, an Israeli analyst on Middle East affairs and author of ""From Terror to Nuclear Bombs: The Significance of the Iranian Threat,"" estimates that ""theoretically"" Iran could develop a nuclear bomb within the next year. But even if Israel's conviction is correct that Iran wants a nuclear weapon and it is close to achieving that desire, does that mean it would use it against Israel? Kam said: ""My personal view is that Iran would not do it because they understand that Israel does have a nuclear arsenal. It has to take that into account and because the U.S. will deter Iran as well. ""If you ask me, can you guarantee they will not use it, then no I can't."" But that question is a step too far for Israel. It is far more concerned with what a nuclear Iran could do to the balance of the Middle East and the likely nuclear race that would follow with many of Israel's neighbors. As Gold says: ""What is a prime minister of Israel supposed to do when he sees that threat growing to his east?""","Hezbollah, a prominent militant group, is currently at the top of Lebanon's threat list, posing a significant danger to the country. This organization's extensive arsenal, political influence, and history of violent activities have contributed to the destabilization of Lebanon and heightened tensions in the region.",Who is at the top of Isreal's threat list?,['Iran'],1
401,"(CNN) -- Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee on Tuesday said he accepts ""full responsibility"" for granting clemency in 2000 to a man authorities say gunned down four Lakewood, Washington, police officers Sunday. Maurice Clemmons, 37, was shot and killed early Tuesday by Seattle police. He was the subject of a two-day manhunt after the four officers were killed at a coffee shop as they met before their shifts began Sunday morning. Clemmons had a criminal history in Arkansas and Washington. In May 2000, Huckabee commuted his 108-year prison sentence to make him immediately eligible for parole, which was granted by the parole board two months later. Clemmons had been sentenced to 95 years, to run after time he was already serving on previous convictions. In a statement on the conservative news Web site Newsmax.com, Huckabee wrote that he commuted Clemmons' sentence from 108 years to 47 years. Reports that he had pardoned Clemmons or set him free were erroneous, he said. ""I take full responsibility for my actions of nine years ago,"" Huckabee said. ""I acted on the facts presented to me in 2000. If I could have possibly known what Clemmons would do nine years later, I obviously would have made a different decision. But if the same file was presented to me today, I would have likely made the same decision."" But the Arkansas prosecutor who put Clemmons behind bars told CNN on Tuesday that Huckabee was issuing clemency at ""an astounding rate"" during his tenure as governor. ""He was exercising the clemency power at what I call a wholesale rate,"" Larry Jegley said. ""He was letting murderers out, he was letting rapists out, and he was letting the likes of Mr. Clemmons out."" One survey, he said, showed Huckabee issued more clemencies from 1996 to 2004 than the governors of all six surrounding states, including Texas. He said he didn't know why so many clemencies were granted. ""That was part of the frustration that we felt with the entire process. ... We never felt as though he gave victims, their families, jurors, law enforcement and the community in general an adequate explanation as to why he felt compelled to let people of proven danger go in our community."" Huckabee was a Republican presidential candidate in the 2008 election and has not ruled out another White House bid in 2012. During his 2008 campaign, he was criticized for granting clemency to another inmate, convicted rapist Wayne DuMond, who was later convicted of raping and murdering a woman in Missouri. ""Between 1,000 and 2,000 requests for some form of clemency came to my desk each and every one of the 10½ years I was governor,"" Huckabee said Tuesday. ""Ninety-two percent of the time, I denied the requests."" He noted that in Arkansas, a governor does not initiate a sentence change -- the Post Prison Transfer Board makes a recommendation to the governor after reviewing an inmate's file. The governor then can grant or deny it. Clemmons was 16 when he was charged with robbery and burglary. ""For the crimes he committed and the age at which he committed the crimes, [a 108-year sentence] was dramatically outside the norm for sentencing,"" Huckabee said. The board unanimously recommended that the sentence be commuted. Jegley said that while in prison in Arkansas, Clemmons had a disciplinary record for violent incidents, and that something should have tipped off the board or the governor that ""this man was not a good candidate to be put back in society, because he couldn't live in the cloistered environment of prison and stay out of trouble."" Watch what Jegley has to say In the case of any form of clemency -- a commutation or a full pardon -- notice is given to the prosecutor, the judge, law enforcement officials, the attorney general and the secretary of state, as well as the media, for a public response period, Huckabee said.

405,"New York (CNN) -- The serendipitous occurrence of this year's Thanksgiving holiday on the same evening as the Muslim Eid-ul-Adha is a festive occasion to reflect on the place of Islam in American collective consciousness and on Muslims as Americans. On the same evening that millions of Americans gather around their Thanksgiving dinner to celebrate this most American of holidays, even more millions of Muslims around the globe, including the growing number of American Muslims, will do the same -- celebrating as well one of the most definitive moments of their faith -- Prophet Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son for his God. This holiday celebration comes soon after the tragic incident at Fort Hood, when the atrocious act of a mass murderer put Islam and Muslims under some pressure to either denounce or defend their faith. The psychotic act of Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, MD, a Muslim American military psychiatrist at Fort Hood who went on a rampage killing 13 U.S. soldiers and wounding 30 others, has prompted two diametrically opposed reactions. On one side are people who say that Islam -- and Islam alone -- is inherently violent and by extension Muslims are constitutionally driven to murder, while on the other are apologetic Muslims who argue their faith is peaceful and benevolent -- unrelated to criminal acts such as Hasan's. The fact is that Maj. Hasan and Osama bin Laden have as much claim on Islam as do Muhammad Ali, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and the Persian poet Mawlana Jalal al-Din Rumi, who is the best-selling poet in America. Islam is an abstraction and any Muslim, saintly or satanic, detested or beloved, can and does have a claim on it -- and Islam is not the only world religion with this proclivity for good and evil. The distinguished New York Times columnist David Brooks, one of the most consistently militant warriors in his take on American involvements in Afghanistan and Iraq, takes Islam -- and Islam alone -- to task for having a diabolic roughness on its fringes. But even if so, Islam is not alone in this failure to curtail murderous instincts. The same Hinduism that produced Mahatma Gandhi and his non-violent theory of civil disobedience has also produced Hindu fundamentalists who sliced and skewered pregnant Muslim women alive in Gujarat. The same Christianity that produced Saint Francis of Assisi and Mother Theresa also produced children's crusades and Spanish conquistadors who burned native Americans alive 13 at a time (according to the 16th-century Spanish Dominican priest, Bartolomé de las Casas) in honor of the Twelve Apostles and Jesus Christ. It also produced American Seung-Hui Cho who killed 32 students and himself at Virginia Tech and American John Wayne Gacy, Jr., who raped and murdered 33 young men and boys in Chicago, Illinois, in the 1970s. The same Judaism that produced Martin Buber, Emanuel Levinas, or Primo Levi also produced the Stern Gang, Meir Kahane and Baruch Goldstein. But the knee jerk reaction of blaming Islam and Muslims, in general, or looking for delusional links to ""al Qaeda,"" for the horrific murders at Fort Hood points to something far more fundamental, overdue, and urgent -- namely something of a psychological barrier for Americans to accept the Islamic component of their own society, culture, and history. To avoid singling out Islam as diabolical, it is imperative for Americans to come to terms with the collectively repressed fact that by far the most important social uprising of their 20th century -- namely the civil rights movement of the 1960s -- is not as exclusively a Christian phenomenon as it is made out to be: The towering figure of a Muslim revolutionary named Malcolm X is of great importance in the history of that movement. It took a whole generation of Americans to accept the fact that Jewish civil rights activists were instrumental in many measures of the success that was achieved in the 1960s. It is long overdue for Americans also to recognize that Malcolm X was equally, if not more, important to the civil rights movement. The way the history of the civil rights movement is mostly remembered now, an overwhelming role is assigned to the Southern Baptist genealogy of Martin Luther King Jr. Malcolm X is","People in the United Kingdom celebrate the Harvest Festival.

To avoid singling out Islam as diabolical, it is imperative for Americans to come to terms with the collectively repressed fact that by far the most important social uprising of their 20th century -- namely the civil rights movement of the 1960s -- is not as exclusively a Christian phenomenon as it is made out to be: The towering figure of a Muslim revolutionary named Malcolm X is of great importance in the history of that movement. It took a whole generation of Americans to accept the fact that Jewish civil rights activists were instrumental in many measures of the success that was achieved in the 1960s. It is long overdue for Americans also to recognize that Malcolm X was equally, if not more, important to the civil rights movement. The way the history of the civil rights movement is mostly remembered now, an overwhelming role is assigned to the Southern Baptist genealogy of Martin Luther King Jr. Malcolm X is",People in the United Kingdom celebrate the Harvest Festival.,Who celebrates Thanksgiving?,['millions of Americans'],1
406,"Beijing, China (CNN) -- Chinese President Hu Jintao greeted U.S. President Barack Obama in China's capital on Tuesday, with trade and the thorny issue of North Korea expected to be on their agenda. The U.S. delegation was met by an honor guard at the Great Hall of the People, and Obama shook hands with Hu and other top Chinese officials before the two leaders went behind closed doors. It is their fifth meeting in the past year, and they made no public statements beforehand but are to issue a joint statement after their talks. The United States imports billions of dollars in Chinese products each year, while China is a major purchaser of the U.S. Treasury bonds that finance America's budget deficit. Facing a global economic recession, Washington and Beijing are in ""a mutual hostage situation,"" former Bush administration China analyst Victor Cha said. ""China needs to purchase these Treasuries in order to maintain a strong dollar. Otherwise, the value of their foreign currency holdings goes down dramatically,"" Cha told CNN. ""We need China in order to finance a lot of the deficit spending we're doing now. It's very much intertwined in a way that two countries in the history of international relations have not been intertwined."" China is also an important player in the diplomatic showdowns over nuclear programs in Iran and North Korea and holds one of five permanent seats on the U.N. Security Council. China is North Korea's closest ally and has played a key role in the six-party talks aimed at convincing Pyongyang to dismantle its nuclear weapons program. A CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey released Monday found 71 percent of Americans consider China an economic threat to the United States, with two-thirds considering it a source of unfair competition for U.S. companies. The survey also found 51 percent of the U.S. public consider China a military threat, with 47 percent disagreeing. That 4-point margin is within the poll's 4.5 percent sampling error. But Obama told students at a town hall-style meeting in Shanghai that the two nations don't have to be at odds with each other. ""Our relationship has not been without disagreement and difficulty, but the notion that we must be adversaries is not predestined,"" Obama said. But he said there are certain core principles that all people must share -- including equal rights for everyone, a government that reflects the will of the people, open commerce, free access to information, and the rule of law. ""We do not seek to impose any system of government on any other nation, but we also don't believe that the principles that we stand for are unique to our nation,"" he told the gathering. The issue of human rights has often been a sticking point between Beijing and Washington. China regularly cracks down on its religious and ethnic minorities, keeps tight reins on the media and censors the Internet. Obama told the students that he is against censorship and is a believer in the free flow of information, calling it a ""source of strength"" in a democracy, despite the sting that sometimes comes with it. He told the students he welcomes a strong China, saying there are very few global challenges -- specifically referring to climate change -- that can't be solved if the United States and China work together. The town hall meeting was shown locally on Shanghai's Phoenix TV, but it was not broadcast nationally on any of China's state-run networks. The Xinhua news agency posted a translated running transcript of the event on its Web site. The United States also streamed the forum live on WhiteHouse.gov.

""I used to have the white suit, and I'd wear it on my birthday. I used to moonwalk ... I remember my mum used to send me to lessons to be like Michael Jackson. And when I heard the news, I had tears in my eyes because of that connection I had because of all the songs he used to play.""

413,"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Israel agreed to release a notorious killer Sunday in order to bring closure to the families of three missing military men, a government spokesman said. An Israeli woman stands in front of posters of captured soldiers Sunday in Jerusalem. ""It's not an easy decision,"" Mark Regev told CNN. ""One of the people being released is a brutal murderer, a man that with his own hands killed infants -- a terrible crime, but this is a nasty business."" He was referring to Samir Kuntar, the longest-serving Lebanese prisoner in Israel, who is hailed as a hero by Hezbollah. Kuntar was convicted for a 1979 attack in which he shot and killed an Israeli man in front of his 4-year-old daughter before smashing her head against a rock and tossing her into the sea. The victim's 2-year-old daughter was accidentally smothered by her mother, who tried to keep her quiet as they hid from the attackers. Kuntar was convicted for murdering both children in the attack, which the Palestine Liberation Front orchestrated to protest the signing of the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty at Camp David the previous year. Kuntar is one of five Lebanese prisoners who Israel will release in exchange for two Israeli soldiers, Ehud ""Udi"" Goldwasser and Eldad Regev. The Lebanon-based Shiite militant group kindapped the two in a July 2006 raid into northern Israel that left three other Israeli soldiers dead. Hezbollah never gave Israel any indication whether they survived the attack, which sparked a 34-day war, leaving the families in limbo. Before the vote, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told his Cabinet that the two soldiers are not alive, ""as far as we know."" ""We'll have a final answer when they are returned,"" Regev said. Goldwasser and Regev are at the center of the landmark agreement, which has been years in the making, with both sides using the prisoners and intelligence as bartering chips. Under the deal, which the Cabinet approved 22-3 on Sunday, Hezbollah will also release information about Ron Arad, an Israeli navigator who has been missing since he was forced to eject from his plane over Lebanon in October 1986. ""We have an obligation, a moral obligation to their families to bring finality,"" Regev said. ""That if they are in fact no longer living, that their families can have a funeral, that they can have a grave, that they can know that this is over."" Israel has repeatedly attempted to get information about Arad and other missing airmen by using Lebanese detainees as leverage. Former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon promised the Arad family that Kuntar will not be released unless Hezbollah provides information on Arad. In addition to Kuntar and other Lebanese prisoners, Israel will also release Palestinian prisoners and return the remains of dozens of border infiltrators and eight Hezbollah members to Lebanon, according to a statement from the government. Israel will also provide information to the United Nations about four Iranian diplomats who disappeared in Beirut during the 1982 Israeli invasion, the statement said. Earlier this month, Israel deported a Lebanese-born man who served six years in jail on charges of spying for Hezbollah. In exchange, Hezbollah handed over a brown coffin containing the remains of Israeli soldiers killed during the 2006 war.

416,"(Entertainment Weekly) -- Fueled by a hefty dose of tweener love, Zac Efron's ""17 Again"" won this weekend's box office sweepstakes without breaking a sweat. Zac Efron stars in ""17 Again,"" which debuted in the No. 1 slot at the box office. The high school time-warp comedy, which costars Matthew Perry and Leslie Mann, earned $24.1 million, according to studio estimates from the box office tracking firm Nielsen EDI. The film's haul marked another No. 1 debut for Efron, who helped boost ticket sales with an appearance this weekend on Saturday Night Live. In 2007, the musical ""Hairspray,"" which co-starred Efron, opened first at $27.5 million. Last year, Efron's ""High School Musical 3: Senior Year"" bowed with $42 million, and while ""17 Again"" may have fallen short of that mark, it still represents an auspicious maiden voyage for Efron's post-Disney career. Despite the raft of critics who pooh-poohed the film, which received a 61 percent fresh rating on Rottentomatoes.com, audiences were more favorably inclined, giving it a strong A- CinemaScore. Landing at No. 2, the Russell Crowe-Ben Affleck thriller ""State of Play"" pulled in $14.1 million. The film, which garnered generally positive reviews, is the latest of a string of adult-oriented dramas to lag at the box office, although its final tally actually came in somewhat higher than anticipated and was an improvement over the $12.9 million opening for Crowe's last outing, last fall's ""Body of Lies."" While ""17 Again"" mopped up moviegoers on the younger end of the age spectrum, a whopping 75 percent of ""State of Play's"" audience was over 35. Holding steady at No. 3 for the second week in a row, ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" took in another $12.9 million. The film's impressive performance in its fourth weekend brings the grand total for the animated kiddie flick to $162 million the highest this year by a wide margin. ""Hannah Montana: The Movie"" dropped 61 percent from its opening last weekend, but the Miley Cyrus starrer still proved strong enough for the No. 4 spot with $12.7 million, boosting its cumulative gross to $56.2 million. Rounding out the top five, ""Fast & Furious"" still had plenty of gas in the tank, earning $12.3 million in its third weekend for an overall cume of $136.7 million. The same, however, can't be said for the Jason Statham action flick ""Crank High Voltage,"" which sputtered into a distant sixth place with a decidedly low-voltage $6.5 million.

417,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Ariel Binns is cute, smart, outgoing and looks remarkably like first daughter Sasha Obama. Young model Ariel Binns, right, resembles Sasha Obama. The similarity has not gone unnoticed by the fashion industry. Harper's Bazaar magazine cast the 6-year-old Brooklyn, New York, first-grader with model Tyra Banks in a photo spread showing an African-American family in the White House. Binns, a child model, was peering out from under a big wooden desk in an image reminiscent of John F. Kennedy's time in office. When it comes to fashion there's nothing like a powerful brand to boost sales, especially if that brand is a dynamic first family. ""Marketers are finally waking up to it -- you know -- black is beautiful,"" says global branding expert David Rogers who predicts African-American models will play a more prominent role in fashion photography as a direct result of the Obamas. ""It's just going to become part of the fabric of the fashion imagery of pop culture, which is a great thing,"" says Rogers. Watch young first daughter look-alike model » At Wilhelmina Kids, a modeling agency in New York for kids and teens, agents say there is increased demand for first daughter look-alikes. ""It's a trend because, what little girl doesn't want to emulate the first kids?"" said Marlene Wallach, president of Wilhelmina, which represents Binns. Unlike the Bush twins or Chelsea Clinton, global branding experts say the appeal of the Obama girls is unique -- and infinitely marketable. After the first kids appeared in their J.Crew outfits on Inauguration Day, the company's Web site got so many hits, it crashed. ""The most visible, most exciting family in America is this beautiful black family and so people are ready and looking for those kinds of images,"" says branding expert David Rogers, adding that a lot of Americans want to identify and, ""find some sort of connection with this family."" There is a downside. The Obamas were not happy when toy manufacturer Ty Inc. came out with African-American dolls named Sweet Sasha and Marvelous Malia even though the company said the dolls did not look like the Obama girls. First lady Michelle Obama's office said it was ""inappropriate to use young private citizens for marketing purposes."" New York clinical psychologist Judy Kuriansky says many famous families face similar problems. ""I can certainly understand Michelle Obama being protective of her children. Many celebrities in Hollywood feel that way too.

NEW YORK (CNN) -- Ariel Binns is adorable, intelligent, sociable, and has a noticeable similarity in appearance to the first daughter, Sasha Obama. The young model, Ariel Binns, who is pictured on the right, has been noticed for her similarity to Sasha Obama. This resemblance has certainly not gone unnoticed by those in the fashion industry. Harper's Bazaar magazine decided to cast the 6-year-old Brooklyn, New York, first-grader alongside model Tyra Banks in a photo spread that showcased an African-American family residing in the White House. Binns, who is a child model, was captured in a photograph peering out from under a large wooden desk, evoking memories of John F. Kennedy's time in office. 

 In the world of fashion, there is nothing quite like a powerful brand to help boost sales, particularly if that brand is associated with a dynamic first family such as the Obamas. ""Marketers are finally waking up to it -- you know -- black is beautiful,"" says global branding expert David Rogers, who predicts that African-American models will play a more significant role in fashion photography as a direct result of the influence of the Obama family. ""It's just going to become part of the fabric of the fashion imagery of pop culture, which is a great thing,"" adds Rogers. Watch young first daughter look-alike model »

At Wilhelmina Kids, a modeling agency in New York that caters to children and teens, agents have reported an increased demand for models who resemble the first daughter. ""It's a trend because, what little girl doesn't want to emulate the first kids?"" said Marlene Wallach, president of Wilhelmina, the agency that represents Binns. Unlike the Bush twins or Chelsea Clinton, global branding experts claim that the appeal of the Obama girls is unique -- and possesses immense marketability. After the first kids were seen wearing their J.Crew outfits on Inauguration Day, the company's website received so many hits that it crashed. 

 ""The most visible, most exciting family in America is this beautiful black family, and so people are ready and looking for those kinds of images,"" says branding expert David Rogers, adding that a large number of Americans want to identify with and ""find some sort of connection with this family."" However, there is a downside to this phenomenon. The Obamas were not pleased when toy manufacturer Ty Inc. released African-American dolls named Sweet Sasha and Marvelous Malia, even though the company stated that the dolls did not resemble the Obama girls. First lady Michelle Obama's office expressed that it was ""inappropriate to use young private citizens for marketing purposes."" 

 New York clinical psychologist Judy Kuriansky says that many famous families face similar issues. ""I can certainly understand Michelle Obama being protective of her children. Many celebrities in Hollywood feel that way too. They don't want their children exposed to the public because once the child is exposed to the public image, not only are they owned, but they could be used in many different ways, and it takes away from the child growing up as a normal, average child.""

419,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A federal judge has ordered the immediate release into the United States of 17 Chinese Muslims who have been held for several years in the U.S. military facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A guard tower is visible behind razor wire at the military facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. U.S. District Judge Ricardo Urbina on Tuesday ordered the 17 detainees to appear in his Washington courtroom at 10 a.m. Friday and said he would hold a hearing next week to determine under what conditions they will be settled in the United States. The government late Tuesday afternoon announced it would file papers shortly with an appeals court seeking an emergency stay to stop the judge's order in its tracks. The detainees are ethnic Uighurs, from a mostly Muslim autonomous region in western China. They have been in government custody for seven years and have been cleared for release for the past four years to any country willing to take them. No countries have volunteered. The judge, visibly impatient, told government lawyers he wants no delays. ""There is a pressing need for them to be released,"" Urbina declared. When a government lawyer requested one week for authorities to determine how immigration authorities would handle a court-ordered arrival of individuals with no status, Urbina summarily rejected the request. He angrily demanded Immigration and Customs officials not even consider arresting the Uighurs upon arrival. ""I have issued an order. I do not want these people interfered with in any way,"" the judge said. Justice Department lawyers told the judge they will immediately appeal the ruling and seek a stay of the order with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The Justice Department released a statement late Tuesday afternoon protesting Urbina's order. ""Today's ruling presents serious national security and separation of powers concerns and raises unprecedented legal issues,"" said Justice Department chief spokesman Brian Roehrkasse. At the White House, Press Secretary Dana Perino warned the ruling represents a dangerous precedent. ""The district court's ruling, if allowed to stand, could be used as precedent for other detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, including sworn enemies of the United States suspected of planning the attacks of 9/11 who may also seek release into our country,"" she said. Dozens of colorfully dressed members of the Uighur community from the Washington area beamed as they left the courtroom and began embracing. ""We welcome this. It has been a very long time,"" said Amy Reger of the Uyghur Human Rights Project. The United States determined in 2004 the 17 Uighurs are not enemy combatants, but has kept them at Guantanamo while trying to persuade other countries to resettle them. Officials said they were not returned to China because of credible fears they could be mistreated if returned. The Uighurs fled Afghanistan shortly after the U.S.-led bombing campaign began in 2001. They were turned over to U.S. military officials by Pakistani authorities. U.S. intelligence officials alleged the Uighur detainees are associated with the East Turkmenistan Islamist Movement, which the administration designated a terrorist organization in 2002. Lawyers for the Uighurs dispute any terrorist connections. Attorneys for the 17 detainees promised the court that if the judge's ruling stands, a Lutheran church group in Maryland and other service groups are prepared to provide both short-term and long-term care and support for the freed prisoners. Seventeen Uighur homes have been identified to initially house the detainees. Urbina scheduled an October 16 hearing for immigration officials and other government agencies to discuss conditions for the 17 men.","WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A federal judge has ordered the immediate release into the United States of 17 Chinese Muslims who have been held for several years in the U.S. military facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

When Orlean told people she was planning to write a biography of Rin Tin Tin, the German shepherd portrayed in movies and on TV, even her friends were puzzled. ""Whaaat?"" many of them said.

The book is titled ""Rin Tin Tin: The Life and the Legend"" [Simon & Schuster], but it's really about the several dogs that played him. Much like ""The Orchid Thief,"" it's also about obsession.

One of the fascinating things about the book is the way it goes off on tangents -- about Nazi Germany, the 1950s, your own family history -- but still somehow stays on the story of ""Rinty."" Why did you construct the book this way? A: I think writing a book is very much a performance. I'm conscious of how readers will feel following a story when they might have started out thinking, I can't believe I'm reading a book about a TV dog. Where I hope you end up is: Oh wow, this is an amazing story and I never thought about the culture this way. Or I didn't know dogs had weddings in the late 1800s.

Volunteers have answered the call to fill 1 million sandbags this week, Zavoral said. ""We're putting up temporary clay levees, and we've produced sandbags, and we're delivering them to the low-lying neighborhoods,"" he said. Early Tuesday, the river level stood at 27.6 feet, according to the National Weather Service. Flood stage is 18 feet, according to the service. ""We thought we had a couple more weeks, and with the weather and the quick thaw and the rains we've had recently, it's really made it more difficult and it's really sped up the crest,"" Fargo police Sgt. Carlos Nestler said. Residents in Fargo and Moorhead are busy building sandbag dikes along the river's edge. Fargo's Kurt Kaye is doing what he did last year, helping friends protect their home from the rising Red River, which runs through their backyard. Like most residents, he said he's resolved to keep the water at bay. ""I think everyone is a little tired of it, but they'll get behind it and go,"" he said. ""They need to get it done to save their houses."" Zavoral, the city administrator, said Fargo is better prepared this year to deal with a major flood. ""We've spent about $10 million putting in permanent flood protection in some of the neighborhoods and bought out about 26 homes in the low-lying areas,"" he said. City officials have said they believe they'll need about 1 million fewer sandbags than were used last year. Is severe weather happening near you?

Cameroonian President Paul Biya, left, walks with Pope Benedict XVI at the airport in Yaounde, Tuesday. He landed in Cameroon, the first stop on a trip that will also take him to Angola. Sub-Saharan Africa has been hit harder by AIDS and HIV than any other region of the world, according to the United Nations and World Health Organization. There has been fierce debate between those who advocate the use of condoms to help stop the spread of the epidemic and those who oppose it. The pontiff reiterated the Vatican's policy on condom use as he flew from Rome to Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon, CNN Vatican analyst John Allen said. Pope Benedict has always made it clear he intends to uphold the traditional Catholic teaching on artificial contraception -- a ""clear moral prohibition"" -- Allen said. But his remarks Tuesday were among the first times he stated the policy explicitly since he became pope nearly four years ago. He has, however, assembled a panel of scientists and theologians to consider the narrow question of whether to allow condoms for married couples, one of whom has HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. It is still not clear how the pope will rule on the matter, said Allen, who is also a senior correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter. The Catholic Church has long been on the front line of HIV care, he said, adding that it is probably the largest private provider of HIV care in the world. More than 22 million people in sub-Saharan Africa are infected with HIV, according to a 2008 UNAIDS/WHO report. Nine out of 10 children with HIV in the world live in the region, which has 11.4 million orphans because of AIDS, the report said, and 1.5 million people there died of the disease in 2007.","(CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI refused Wednesday to soften the Vatican's ban on condom use as he arrived in Africa for his first visit to the continent as pope.

Immediately after the January 12 quake, the state ""dusted off"" a preparedness plan known as Operation Vigilant Sentry ""just in case,"" he said. The plan has been in place since 2003.

It is based on the expectation that people would first be housed at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba and federal immigration detention centers.

Tens of thousands of people have fled the region as government forces have advanced and rebels have been pushed into a smaller and smaller patch of land. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report.

429,"(CNN) -- American Lindsey Vonn suffered a pre-Olympic scare after taking a crashing fall in the World Cup giant slalom in Lienz on Monday. Vonn, who is a medal favorite in several disciplines for February's Winter Games in Vancouver, damaged her left arm after sliding out on the first run, losing her balance on a bump after a sharp left turn before thumping into a gate. She received lengthy medical treatment on the slope with initial fears that she had broken the arm. But scans at a local hospital showed only severe bruising and the 25-year-old may even compete in Tuesday's slalom at the same venue, U.S. team medical director Richard Quincy told reporters. Vonn's arm has been placed in a splint to speed recovery and she was said to have been in considerable pain. ""Hurting my arm is way better than hurting one of my legs,"" Vonn was quoted on her personal Web site www.lindseyvonn.com. Her crash overshadowed a fine victory for Kathrin Hoelzl of Germany, who led after the first run and posted a combined time of two minutes, 16.61 seconds with Manuela Moelgg of Italy just 0.05 seconds back in second. Taina Barioz of France occupied the final podium position. Vonn retains her lead in the overall standings with 581 points ahead of second-placed Maria Reisch, who appeared distracted by her friend's crash and also skied out first time down. The German is 50 points adrift as Vonn looks to defend her overall crown. Vonn suffered an unusual injury setback at the world championships in Val d'Isere, France earlier this year. Celebrating a medal success, she sliced her thumb open on a champagne bottle and competed for the rest of the season with heavy strapping. Vonn's appearance in Vancouver is being heavily plugged by sponsors and television rights holders, but she is still seeking her first Olympic medal after missing out in Salt Lake City and Turin. Austria's Kathrin Zettel, who led the GS standings going into the race but was overtaken by Hoelzl, was 0.95 seconds behind the German after skiing off-course in her first run and finished fifth. Hoelzl takes the lead in the giant slalom discipline standings, leapfrogging Kathrin Zettel of Austria, who finished fifth.","(CNN) -- In a pre-Olympic fright, American Lindsey Vonn took a dramatic tumble at the World Cup giant slalom event in Lienz, which resulted in an intensely battered limb on Monday.

430,"(CNN) -- Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher could be set to make a shock return to Formula One as Ferrari look for a short-term replacement for the injured Felipe Massa. Michael Schumacher remains very much part of the Ferrari set-up as an advisor for the Formula One team. The 28-year-old Brazilian is currently in intensive care at the AEK military hospital in Budapest after suffering a fractured skull in a freak accident in qualifying for Saturday's Hungarian Grand Prix. Massa's condition has improved in the past 24 hours with doctors taking him out of a medically-induced coma on Monday night. He has since responded well to questions and Peter Bazso, the medical director of the hospital, claimed on Tuesday morning that Massa might be able to walk out of the hospital in 10 days' time. Felipe Massa's crash in pictures. » ""My expectation is that he would walk out of the hospital on his own. If his recovery continues, I wouldn't rule out that he could leave within 10 days,"" Bazso told Hungarian TV channel M1. ""He's spending more and more time awake, talking to family and friends. I would like to point out that, although he is recovering, this is not the end of the story, he is still in a life-threatening condition. Of course, the danger is decreasing by the day."" While the news regarding Massa's condition continues to be encouraging, behind the scenes Ferrari are faced with the task of finding a replacement driver. Doctors have said Massa will be out for at least six weeks, although there are still fears he may never return as a result of his injuries. He will certainly miss the European and Belgian Grands Prix at the end of August, although the current four-week break before the next race in Valencia gives the Italian team time to assess their options. On the list of likely replacements could be Schumacher -- who won five of his drivers' titles with Ferrari and works as an advisor for the team. The 40-year-old German's representative Sabine Kehm told CNN: ""There is no offer from Ferrari, but if they decided they need him, Michael would certainly weigh his options."" Ferrari spokesman Luca Colajanni later confirmed to the Press Association that Schumacher, who retired in 2006, was an option. ""We have said before that it is possible that Michael Schumacher could return to help us out,"" said Colajanni. ""However, we have two test drivers at Ferrari (Luca Badoer and Marc Gene) at the moment and Michael is an advisor. Does safety need to be improved in Formula One? ""We have not spoken to him and we will have to wait and see what happens. It is something for (Ferrari team principal) Stefano Domenicali to consider over the coming weeks. ""We need to see how Felipe is and the situation will evolve from there. We are not in any hurry, the first and foremost thing is Felipe's recovery."" Colajanni also provided further encouraging news regarding Massa, although he played down Bazso's assertion that he could walk out of hospital as early as next week.

Massa was hurt when a spring that had fallen from the back of Rubens Barrichello's Brawn GP car struck him on the helmet at high-speed, causing him to lose control of his car and crash into a tire barrier.

431,"(CNN) -- A little over a week ago nearly every media outlet was fixated on Tiger Woods and his apology news conference. We saw pundits, columnists, journalists, radio talk show hosts, psychologists, body language experts, entertainers and anyone with an opinion weigh in on the sincerity of Tiger: Was he really sorry for committing adultery, should he apologize further and hundreds of other angles. Some even described him as a fallen athlete who will lose millions of endorsements and a man who has destroyed the trust he built up with his fans. I even heard one woman say she needed Tiger to apologize, yet couldn't articulate why it mattered so much to her, especially since she wasn't his wife, kin to him, and wasn't a family friend. Yet if there was ever one athlete we could truly place in that category of fallen athlete, it would be former NBA star Jayson Williams. While Tiger brought shame on himself and his family by his admitted extramarital affairs, he has broken no laws, and what he did doesn't affect us at all. Yet Williams is another matter. This week, he was led away in handcuffs after being sentenced in a New Jersey court for fatally shooting a limo driver on February 14, 2002. Some carried his sentencing live. Yet most networks ignored his case, which ended eight years of courtroom drama. Frankly, if there was a case that is instructive to kids who look up to athletes, it's Jayson, not Tiger. Jayson Williams was a gregarious and fun-loving man who could light up the court. After injuries took their toll and ended his NBA career, he was a rising TV analyst with NBC, a playful man with a big heart. I'll never forget watching him on ""Oprah"" with his dad as they talked about building his huge mansion, how it was a place where hundreds of kids traveled through as a result of his charitable endeavors and how he had a zest for life. But that all ended on the night the life of Costas Christofi ended. After a dinner, Williams returned to his home and was showing several folks his many guns when he snapped his double-barreled 12-gauge shotgun shut. Williams didn't realize it was loaded, and a single bullet hit Christofi in the chest. A panicked Williams put the gun in Christofi's hand, and even jumped in his pool, hoping to wash away the evidence. Williams was acquitted of aggravated manslaughter and convicted on four counts of coverup. He settled with Christofi's family for $2 million, all while the case went back and forth through the legal system. While that was happening, Williams began to lose it all. His wife filed for divorce; he was hit with a stun gun by police after an encounter; he crashed his vehicle in another incident and threatened to kill himself. Williams was a man who fell victim to alcohol and guns, a deadly combination. He was sentenced to five years in jail and is eligible for parole in 18 months. Everything he had -- money, fame, budding TV career, marriage, friends, respect -- all lost because of the horrible decisions he made one fateful night. Jayson Williams didn't achieve the level of fame as Tiger Woods, but we can surely learn more from his fall from grace than Tiger's. The former killed a man, the latter cheated on his wife. Both morally wrong, only one legally wrong. Tiger will undoubtedly return to the golf course one day. Sure, he can fret about losing millions in endorsements and may have to confront losing his wife. But Williams must forever live with the memory of a man dying as a result of his actions. We all may want to focus on Tiger, but it's the tragedy of Jayson Williams that should have all of us talking and examining what went wrong in the charmed life of a basketball star.

433,"Jerusalem (CNN) -- As a deadline neared, Israel handed the United Nations Friday a report justifying its actions during last year's Gaza campaign and rebutting the so-called ""Goldstone Report"" as biased. At a tree-planting ceremony southern Israel Friday, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said, ""This report stresses that the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) is like no other army, both from a moral standpoint as well as from a professional standpoint. ""The Goldstone Report is a distorted, false, and irresponsible report,"" Barak said. ""All of the soldiers and officers whom we sent to battle need to know that the state of Israel stands behind them even on the day after."" ""The Gaza Operation Investigations: An Update"" -- a follow-up of a July paper on the Gaza mission -- is in response to the United Nations' call for both the Jewish state and the Palestinian Hamas movement to conduct independent inquiries to examine charges that both sides committed war crimes during the course of the Gaza war fought just over a year ago. Israel's 46-page response outlines the steps the nation has taken to investigate charges of wrongdoing by its military during the course of its three-week offensive -- dubbed Operation Cast Lead -- in Gaza aimed at stopping militant rocket fire into Israel. Israel says it faced ""asymmetric conflicts"" and blamed ""militants operating from within and behind civilian areas"" for placing civilians at risk. The Israeli military has ""launched investigations into 150 separate incidents, including 36 criminal investigations opened thus far,"" according to the report. ""Israel is committed to ensuring that every such incident is fully and fairly investigated, to ensure that lessons can be learned and that, if justified, criminal or disciplinary proceedings initiated,"" the report stated. ""To this end the IDF policy requires that every allegation of wrongdoing be investigated, irrespective of its source."" The report does not mention whether Israel will conduct an independent, non-military investigation of the charges of war crimes and possible crimes against humanity leveled in the Goldstone Report. Released in September, the 575-page report written by a commission chaired by South African Judge Richard Goldstone alleged that both Hamas and Israel committed war crimes and may have also committed crimes against humanity during the course of fighting that killed some 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis. The majority of criticism in the report was reserved for Israel which has waged an aggressive international public relations campaign to discredit the probe's findings. With the publication of the report, the United Nations asked both Israel and Hamas to initiate independent investigations into the the various allegations and report back before February 5 when the General Assembly will be taking up the report and its recommendations. Among those recommendations were the call for the report's findings to be passed on to the International Criminal Court if both sides did not start legitimate investigations into war crimes. In Israel, the military has conducted investigations into possible wrong-doing itself which has raised criticism from human rights groups and some Israeli lawmakers that a more credible investigation is needed. Israel's outgoing attorney-general Menachem Mazuz told the Haaretz newspaper Friday ""Israel has a clear interest in conducting a serious, expert examination that will deal with the (Goldstone) report and produce an opposing report."" In Gaza, the ruling Hamas movement this week released a 20-page summary of the steps it has taken to investigate wrong-doing, contending it had prevented militants from rocketing Israeli civilians and that any examples to the contrary were a result of mistaken fire. It was a claim quickly dismissed by the by human rights organizations and the Israeli government.

434,"(CNN) -- Nigerian footballer Stephen Worgu has been sentenced to 40 lashes after he was convicted of drinking alcohol in Sudan where he plays for first division side Al-Merreikh of Omdurman. The 20-year-old forward, who joined the northern Sudan outfit in October 2008, was found guilty of drinking alcohol and driving under the influence by an east Khartoum court. Alcohol is illegal in the Muslim north of Sudan according to Article 78 of the penal code, although it is not in the semi-autonomous and largely non-Muslim south. The court ordered Worgu to pay a fine of $20 for the alcohol consumption, $80 for driving under the influence as well as receiving 40 lashes for the incident which is said to have taken place in the capital Khartoum on August 21. The forward's lawyer has appealed against the punishment for the player who had previously admitted in interviews that he had struggled to adapt to the different culture and religious life in Sudan. Worgu, who has been a regular for the Nigerian Under-20 side, had moved to Al-Merreikh for $2.6 million from Enyimba in Nigeria ahead of Egyptian side Al-Ahly in what was one of the biggest transfers in African football.

440,"(CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration Tuesday ordered the makers of certain antibiotics to add a ""black box"" label warning -- the FDA's strongest -- to alert patients of possible tendon ruptures and tendonitis. Cipro is one of the drugs for which the FDA will require a ""black box"" label warning about tendon problems. ""The new language will strengthen the existing warnings,"" said Dr. Edward Cox, director of the FDA's Office of Antimicrobial Products. The FDA is requiring the label warnings and a medication guide for fluoroquinolone drugs, which include Cipro, Levaquin, Avelox, Noroxin and Floxin. The consumer group Public Citizen asked the FDA in August 2006 to put the ""black box"" warning on Cipro and other fluoroquinolones, and also to warn doctors. Earlier this year, Public Citizen filed a lawsuit to force the FDA to take those actions. Public Citizen said Tuesday it was ""pleased"" with the FDA's order but added ""there is still more that the FDA must do."" ""The FDA is silent on our request that it also send a warning letter to physicians clearly describing possible adverse reactions, such as tendon pain, so that patients can be switched to alternative treatments before tendons rupture,"" the group said. ""We are troubled that the FDA is not doing everything within its power to prevent more people from needlessly suffering disabling tendon ruptures."" When asked about the lawsuit and why it didn't order the ""black box"" label warning until now, Cox stressed that the FDA included warning information with the drugs from 2001 until 2004, and updated the information last year. Dr. Gupta explains more on antibiotic risks » ""There has been ongoing work to update the labeling of the fluoroquinolone drug products,"" Cox said. ""We have been working on this issue and making progress over time."" The companies that make the fluoroquinolone drugs will be required to submit label safety changes and the medication guide within 30 days of receiving the notification from the FDA or provide a reason why they do not believe such labeling changes are necessary, Cox said. Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc., which holds licenses for Cipro and Avelox, said it would make the changes requested by the FDA but defended the drugs as ""well-tolerated and effective in all approved indications."" Schering-Plough markets Cipro and Avelox in the United States under agreement with Bayer. Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals, which markets Levaquin in the United States, also said it would abide by the FDA's request. Merck & Co., the maker of Noroxin, said it, too, would update the drug's label. But Merck noted it has stopped promotion of Noroxin because of the widespread availability of its generic form. Oscient Pharmaceuticals (Factive), Daiichi Sankyo (Floxin) and Dipomed (Proquin) did not immediately respond to CNN's requests for comment. The fluoroquinolones drugs can increase the risk of tendonitis and tendon rupture -- which is about 1 in 100,000 -- by three to four times, according to the FDA's Dr. Renata Albrecht. ""This risk is further increased in those over age 60, in kidney, heart, and lung transplant recipients, and with use of concomitant steroid therapy,"" the FDA said in a statement. Albrecht said that sometimes patients have no symptoms before they experience a rupture in their tendon -- commonly their Achilles tendon. ""Sometimes it's been reported on the first day of taking a fluoroquinolone ... a sudden snap or popping sound that is tendon rupture with no preceding warning,"" she said. Normally, she added, that patients experience some pain or inflammation ""a week or two before the patient will rupture."" Public Citizen, founded in 1971 by consumer activist Ralph Nader, said more than 400 cases of tendon rupture and more than 300 cases of tendonitis in patients using fluoroquinolones were reported between November 1997 and December 2007. ""Because only a small fraction of cases are typically reported to the FDA, the actual number of ruptures and other tendon injuries attributable to the antibiotic is much higher,"" the group said","In addition to Cipro, Levaquin, Avelox, and Noroxin, Penicillin is also another relevant drug that plays a significant role in the medical field. These medications, including Penicillin, are essential for treating various bacterial infections and have greatly contributed to the advancement of modern medicine.

Akshay Kumar is one of the biggest names in Indian film. In reality, Kumar has no need for such humility. One of the biggest names in Indian film, he's increasingly rubbing shoulders with the global glitterati these days. In ""Kambakkht Ishq,"" he plays a Hollywood stuntman alongside Stallone and Richards, who have cameos in the film. He starred this year with U.S. rapper Snoop Dogg in the film ""Singh is Kinng,"" and he's set to appear in a film alongside Australian pop star Kylie Minogue later in the year. The unstoppable rise of Bollywood and the massive popularity of Indian film beyond its homeland have made stars like Kumar hot property. The poster boy of Indian action films now finds himself at the vanguard of the crossover between the world's two largest movie industries. Watch Kumar speak to CNN about his upcoming projects » The Hollywood men in suits have been eyeing the Indian market greedily for some time. While the economic downturn has hit Tinseltown hard, Bollywood is a rising tiger -- the industry was worth $15 billion in 2008 and is projected to grow by 10 percent, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. With the notable exception of this year's runaway Oscar hit ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" attempts to make crossover films for both markets have largely failed. The masala mix of genres and exaggerated acting that typifies the Bollywood formula has met limited success in the West. Instead Hollywood studios have begun bankrolling Bollywood productions solely for the Indian market. But the financial traffic is by no means one-way. In the other direction, Steven Spielberg's Dreamworks recently snagged a multi-million dollar film production deal with Reliance Big Entertainment, one of Bollywood's biggest hitters. For Kumar, the strengthening of ties between Hollywood and Bollywood is bringing many opportunities, including the chance to work alongside his childhood hero Stallone. ""Well it was great. It was an honor to work with him,"" he told CNN. In addition to starring in ""Kambakkht Ishq,"" his other major role this year was as an Indian chef who learns martial arts in ""Chandni Chowk Goes to China."" The movie was financed by Warner Brothers. (Warner Brothers, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner.) The typically flamboyant plot of ""Chandni Chowk"" was loosely inspired by Kumar's own life. Born in Punjab but raised in Delhi, he came to acting late after working as a waiter in Bangkok. While staying in the Thai capital, he gained expertise in martial arts, which he later taught in India prior to transitioning into a career as a male model. He landed his first movie role in the 1992 Hindi language film ""Deeder"" and has gone on to become one of Bollywood's leading men. He is married to fellow actor Twinkle Khanna. The couple created a buzz in India when they fell foul of the country's notoriously strict obscenity laws in March after Kumar encouraged his wife to undo the top button of his jeans at a fashion show in Mumbai. A complaint was lodged with the police and they were briefly questioned. With more than 80 features to his name, Kumar maintains that a strong work ethic is the reason for his longevity in the movie business. ""I think it's the simplest thing. It's actually hard work and punctuality,"" the 41-year-old told CNN from the London set of his latest movie, a comedy called ""Housefull."" ""Even if you're not a good actor, to be a producer's actor is essential. If you finish your films on time you save money for the producer,"" he noted.

447,"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- South Africa's police chief said Monday that violence directed at foreign nationals had killed 22 people over the past week. Police carry an unidentified Malawi national on an improvised stretcher after he was badly beaten in Reiger Park township. The attacks have been concentrated in Johannesburg's poorest areas, and many of the victims were Zimbabweans who have fled repression and dire economic circumstances. The Nelson Mandela Foundation issued a statement condemning the ""senseless violence"" that police say was sparked a week ago in Johannesburg's Alexandra Township. ""We join the rest of South Africa in deploring this violence,"" said Achmat Dangor, CEO of the Nelson Mandela Foundation, according to a statement released on Monday. ""Whatever the underlying causes they have to be addressed, but this senseless violence is not a solution.""

South Africa's police director Govindsamy Mariemuthoo said 22 people had been killed in the past week. The Red Cross estimates some 3,000 more were displaced. The attacks were concentrated in some of the poorest parts of South Africa where locals are jobless, hungry and in need of basic services such as clean water, sanitation and housing. South African President Thabo Mbeki called for an investigation into the violence. He has been reluctant to describe it as xenophobic because many South Africans have criticized his government for not doing enough to deal with the crisis in neighboring Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe is in the midst of an economic collapse, with nearly 80 percent unemployment and inflation estimated to be at 160,000 percent. In addition, it is also in a state of political limbo.

The move comes as tensions over the territory simmer because of British oil companies' efforts to drill off the northern coast of the islands.

But Argentina has always claimed sovereignty over them. The two nations fought a war over the islands in 1982.

451,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Four militants armed with guns and grenades stormed a mosque in Rawalpindi frequented by military personnel, killing dozens of people Friday -- most of them children, the military said. The attack is the latest to shake the garrison city since this year's launch of strong military offensives against Taliban insurgents in the Swat Valley and South Waziristan. Rawalpindi is the headquarters of the Pakistani army. Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas said Friday's assault killed 36 people and wounded 75. Among the dead were 17 children, according to the military's Web site. Also killed were an army general and eight other military officials, six of them of senior rank. The remaining fatalities were adults. ""As soon as the mosque's security staff checked me, there was a blast and then a finger hit me, then there was another,"" Ishtiaq, a driver for a military officer, told GEO TV. Ishtiaq, who uses only one name, was attending midday prayers. Rawalpindi is near Islamabad, and the mosque is near national army headquarters. It is located inside a walled residential compound where many military families have homes. A witness told GEO TV there were up to 300 worshippers at the mosque at the time of the attack. The militants hurled grenades before opening fire, Rawalpindi Police Chief Aslam Tareen told CNN. He said all the militants died, but he doesn't know how. ""These are not militants,"" Abbas said. ""These are terrorists who killed innocent worshippers."" Retired Gen. Muhammad Yousaf was killed in the attack, said Col. Baseer Haider, a military spokesman. He said Yousaf was a former vice chief of army staff who was second in command during the administration of President Pervez Musharraf. Abbas said two of the attackers were suicide bombers who blew themselves up inside the Parade Lane mosque; the other two were shot and killed by security forces outside the mosque. Several explosions were heard inside the mosque around 1:30 p.m. (3:30 a.m. ET), followed by gunfire, Abbas said. The militants entered the compound by climbing over a wall, Tareen said. This is the first attack in Rawalpindi since a suicide bomber targeted a bank on November 2. On October 10, militants stormed army headquarters in Rawalpindi, taking several people hostage before security forces killed them.

Among the dead were 17 children, according to the military's Web site. Also killed were an army general and eight other military officials, six of them of senior rank. The remaining fatalities were adults. ""As soon as the mosque's security staff checked me, there was a blast and then a finger hit me, then there was another,"" Ishtiaq, a driver for a military officer, told GEO TV. Ishtiaq, who uses only one name, was attending midday prayers. Rawalpindi is near Islamabad, and the mosque is near national army headquarters. It is located inside a walled residential compound where many military families have homes. A witness told GEO TV there were up to 300 worshippers at the mosque at the time of the attack. The militants hurled grenades before opening fire, Rawalpindi Police Chief Aslam Tareen told CNN. He said all the militants died, but he doesn't know how. ""These are not militants,"" Abbas said. ""These are terrorists who killed innocent worshippers."" Retired Gen. Muhammad Yousaf was killed in the attack, said Col. Baseer Haider, a military spokesman. He said Yousaf was a former vice chief of army staff who was second in command during the administration of President Pervez Musharraf. Abbas said two of the attackers were suicide bombers who blew themselves up inside the Parade Lane mosque; the other two were shot and killed by security forces outside the mosque. Several explosions were heard inside the mosque around 1:30 p.m. (3:30 a.m. ET), followed by gunfire, Abbas said. The militants entered the compound by climbing over a wall, Tareen said. This is the first attack in Rawalpindi since a suicide bomber targeted a bank on November 2. On October 10, militants stormed army headquarters in Rawalpindi, taking several people hostage before security forces killed them. CNN's Reza Sayah contributed to this report.","The church, a popular destination, is frequented by local residents and tourists alike who appreciate its beauty and significance.

452,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's father wants a judge to order the pop star's estate to pay him a monthly allowance, according to papers filed in court Friday. Joe Jackson, the 80-year-old Jackson family patriarch, was not named in Michael Jackson's 2002 will, which left his wealth to his mother, Katherine Jackson, his three children and undisclosed charities. Brian Oxman, Joe Jackson's lawyer, filed the petition Friday asking for him to be included in the family allowance. The matter will be considered Tuesday when Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff convenes the next hearing on matters related to the probate of Jackson's will, Oxman said.

""It was quite surprising to learn of the request,"" Weitzman said. Michael Jackson's mother and his three children receive a court-ordered allowance from the estate totaling more than $86,000 a month, according to court documents.

""RIP Kurt."" Fifteen years ago Wednesday, at a house adjacent to the park, Kurt Cobain's dead body was discovered by an electrician. The Nirvana frontman, 27, had committed suicide, police later ruled, killing himself with a shotgun while high on heroin and pills. His death ended a battle with hard drugs and added Cobain to a long list of legendary musicians, such as Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin, whose careers were cut short by their addictions. Cobain's ashes were reportedly scattered in a Washington state river and a New York Buddhist temple. Nirvana band mates Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl eventually formed other bands. Cobain's widow, Courtney Love, stayed in the limelight with an acting career and legal problems surrounding her own drug problems.

456,"Editor's note: José Miguel Vivanco is executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch, a nonprofit organization that seeks to protect people's rights. A lawyer from Chile, he was educated there, in Spain and at Harvard Law School. José Miguel Vivanco says conviction of Peru's ex-president is a warning to those who deny human rights. (CNN) -- Peruvians are celebrating an extraordinary victory this week: the conviction of their former president, Alberto Fujimori, for death squad killings carried out during his rule in the 1990s. The Peruvian Supreme Court found him guilty of egregious human rights abuses, including the massacre of innocent civilians, and sentenced him to 25 years in prison -- a stiff message to other leaders that justice can eventually catch up to even the most powerful. It is one of the first times a nation's own independent courts have convicted a former leader for such serious human rights crimes and it sets an important precedent for a region that suffered so much from political violence and rights violations. Equally significant, the ruling came after a lengthy televised trial, which was clearly fair to the defendant -- despite Peru's previous history of authoritarianism and weak rule of law. Fujimori came to office in 1990 on the promise of crushing a vicious Maoist insurgency but, in the process of restoring order, he corrupted and weakened Peru's most vital government institutions -- including parliament, the courts and law enforcement. Just a few years ago, Fujimori had near-total control of Peru's judiciary. For a decade, his government used bribery, extortion, and intimidation to concentrate power in the presidency, subverting the democratic process and eliminating normal checks by the judiciary, legislature, and media on government abuses. He led Peru from 1990 to 2000, presiding over the war with the Shining Path guerrillas and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement. He was convicted of authorizing killings and kidnappings by paramilitary death squads. Fujimori is to be tried separately on multiple corruption charges. The landmark decision fits within a global trend of increasing accountability for former heads of state. Just 20 years ago, it was exceedingly rare for even the most brutal leaders to be brought to book. In the late 20th century, Mao Zedong, Idi Amin, Milton Obote, Ferdinand Marcos, Anastasio Somoza, Jean-Claude ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier and Mobutu Sese Seko, to name just a few, were never brought to trial. Since then, however, the tide has turned. In October 1998, London police arrested General Augusto Pinochet on a warrant from a Spanish judge for human rights crimes. The arrest and the subsequent decisions by the British House of Lords to reject Pinochet's claim of immunity were a wake-up call to tyrants everywhere, but more important, they gave hope to victims elsewhere that they too could bring their tormentors to justice. In country after country, particularly in Latin America, victims were inspired to challenge the amnesty laws of the 1980s and 1990s that had allowed the perpetrators of atrocities to go unpunished and, often, to remain in power. Thanks to these efforts, former leaders in Argentina, and Uruguay have also faced human rights trials. Pinochet's arrest also strengthened a nascent international movement -- spurred by the killings in Bosnia and Rwanda, and facilitated by the end of the Cold War -- to make certain the worst abuses are punished. After the creation of UN tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, the world established the International Criminal Court (ICC) to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and serious war crimes when national courts are unable or unwilling to do so. The ICC is now investigating crimes in the Central African Republic, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in March the court indicted President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan on charges of crimes against humanity in Darfur. The Fujimori case stands out, though, because it was Peru's national court system which demonstrated the will, capacity, and independence to try its former president. A second panel of the Supreme Court will now review an appeal by Fujimori. One can hope the second panel will be as","Montesinos, a notorious figure, was ultimately convicted of human rights abuses and faced corruption charges as well. This conviction came after evidence surfaced of Montesinos' involvement in illegal activities such as bribery, embezzlement, and orchestrating the torture and disappearance of political opponents during his time in power.

For a decade, his government used bribery, extortion, and intimidation to concentrate power in the presidency, subverting the democratic process and eliminating normal checks by the judiciary, legislature, and media on government abuses. He led Peru from 1990 to 2000, presiding over the war with the Shining Path guerrillas and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement. He was convicted of authorizing killings and kidnappings by paramilitary death squads. Fujimori is to be tried separately on multiple corruption charges. The landmark decision fits within a global trend of increasing accountability for former heads of state. Just 20 years ago, it was exceedingly rare for even the most brutal leaders to be brought to book. In the late 20th century, Mao Zedong, Idi Amin, Milton Obote, Ferdinand Marcos, Anastasio Somoza, Jean-Claude ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier and Mobutu Sese Seko, to name just a few, were never brought to trial. Since then, however, the tide has turned. In October 1998, London police arrested General Augusto Pinochet on a warrant from a Spanish judge for human rights crimes. The arrest and the subsequent decisions by the British House of Lords to reject Pinochet's claim of immunity were a wake-up call to tyrants everywhere, but more important, they gave hope to victims elsewhere that they too could bring their tormentors to justice. In country after country, particularly in Latin America, victims were inspired to challenge the amnesty laws of the 1980s and 1990s that had allowed the perpetrators of atrocities to go unpunished and, often, to remain in power. Thanks to these efforts, former leaders in Argentina, and Uruguay have also faced human rights trials. Pinochet's arrest also strengthened a nascent international movement -- spurred by the killings in Bosnia and Rwanda, and facilitated by the end of the Cold War -- to make certain the worst abuses are punished. After the creation of UN tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, the world established the International Criminal Court (ICC) to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and serious war crimes when national courts are unable or unwilling to do so. The ICC is now investigating crimes in the Central African Republic, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in March the court indicted President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan on charges of crimes against humanity in Darfur. The Fujimori case stands out, though, because it was Peru's national court system which demonstrated the will, capacity, and independence to try its former president. A second panel of the Supreme Court will now review an appeal by Fujimori. One can hope the second panel will be as","Montesinos, a notorious figure, was ultimately convicted of human rights abuses and faced corruption charges as well. This conviction came after evidence surfaced of Montesinos' involvement in illegal activities such as bribery, embezzlement, and orchestrating the torture and disappearance of political opponents during his time in power.",What was Fujimori convicted of?,['for death squad killings carried out during his rule in the 1990s.'],1

462,"(CNN) -- Robert Barnett, a prominent Washington attorney, has worked on eight national presidential campaigns, focusing on debate preparation. He played the role of George H.W. Bush in practice debates with Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 and with Michael Dukakis in 1988, and practice debated Bill Clinton more than 20 times during the 1992 campaign. He also played the role of Dick Cheney in 2000 and 2004 and helped prepare Hillary Clinton for 23 primary debates for the 2008 nomination. Barnett spoke with CNNI's Michael Holmes. Robert Barnett has been in practice debates with Democrats from Geraldine Ferraro to Bill Clinton. CNN: How does Tuesday night's town hall format differ from other debates? Barnett: The individuals will not necessarily express the question as a journalist would. So, for example, one of these people will probably not ask about Internal Revenue Service Code section 341, but rather will ask about their taxes and their tax burdens and what they care about with respect to taxation. And so you have to be very careful to be sure you understand what the individual is asking about and you have to be particularly careful to answer the question, because if you don't, you risk alienating the questioner and the audience and the listeners. CNN: You're in a unique position. You have prepped, I think, seven or eight presidential campaigns. You've done debate prep, you've stood in and played the role of Dick Cheney and others. What's that like? What are you trying to do to prepare the candidate, any candidate? Barnett: If I'm playing the surrogate, if you will, if I'm the Republican for a Democrat, I try to prepare myself -- not to imitate; I'm not Darrell Hammond or Dana Carvey. I'm not that talented. But I try to be ready with what my candidate that I'm playing, if you will, has said -- the exact words used, the way they counterattack, the way they attack. And I try to make sure that the candidate I'm working with, meaning the Democrat, has heard just about everything that they could hear from their opponent before they ever walk on the stage. CNN: Do you try to bait them, get them to bite a little and then say that's not what you should be doing? Barnett: Well, it can get pretty contested. When I prepared with Rep. Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 when she was running against then-vice president George Herbert Walker Bush, I baited her a lot and she got so angry with me that she frequently walked over to me and slugged me on the arm. So I left the process black and blue. CNN: When you're doing that sort of thing, how direct can you be with the candidate? Or do you have to treat them with a bit of kid gloves? Barnett: I treat them with no kid gloves. It's fair to say I'm direct, I make sure they hear everything from me before they hear it on the stage and maybe hear it even a little more aggressively so they can be prepared.","Tom Hanks has played several Democrats in various movies and television shows.

463,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Perhaps Ryan Seacrest said it best at the top of the ""American Idol"" Tuesday night when describing Adam Lambert and Kris Allen, the show's final two contestants. In this corner: Kris Allen, the guy next door. ""It is the battle of the acoustic rocker versus the glam rocker. Conway (Arkansas) versus California. The guy next door versus the guy-liner."" After three performances apiece and plenty of judge feedback, it seems that the Southern California glam-rocker Adam Lambert has the edge -- but it didn't look that way early in Tuesday's show. In the first round, where the contestants chose a song from a favorite past performance this season, Simon Cowell declared Kris Allen the winner after his rendition of ""Ain't No Sunshine"" on piano. Watch Allen and Lambert talk after the show » Lambert chose to sing ""Mad World"" while wearing a long black coat and walking around a stage filled with white smoke, all of which Cowell found ""over-theatrical."" ""I think 'Mad World' is kind of symbolic,"" Lambert told reporters after the show. ""It talks about people who don't feel like they fit in."" Round two featured a tune hand-picked by ""American Idol"" creator Simon Fuller, where Lambert ditched the black overcoat and belted out Sam Cooke's ""A Change Is Gonna Come"" while sporting a shiny silver suit. Paula Abdul told Lambert ""it was the best I've ever heard you sing, ever!"" Allen's feedback after singing Marvin Gaye's classic ""What's Goin' On"" in the second round was much less flattering. See the best and worst performances from season eight » ""I thought it was too laid back for a night like this,"" said Cowell. He then gave round two to Lambert. Round three featured a bit of a twist -- both contestants had to sing a song co-written by judge Kara DioGuardi called ""No Boundaries."" Lambert went first and had little difficulty with the ballad. Cowell told the 27-year-old afterward that ""you have been one of the best, most original contestants we've ever had on the show."" Allen, however, struggled to stay in tune during the entire performance ... but the judges were less harsh this time. ""You have thoroughly, thoroughly deserved to be standing on that stage tonight, congratulations,"" said Cowell. Watch anchors debate ""Idol"" finalists » After the show, Lambert told reporters that they did not have a lot of time to work on ""No Boundaries"" and it was kind of a ""rush job."" ""There was a lot of lyric, and it was a big song,"" said Lambert. ""But it's a beautiful song."" It almost seems appropriate that these two are facing off in the finale. According to Allen, he and Lambert were once roommates during the competition. They even critique each other's rehearsals. ""He's always giving me stuff to change about mine ... to make it better,"" Allen told reporters. iReport.com: Who should win: Kris or Adam? A little over an hour before the show began, a magnitude 4.0 quake aftershock hit 10 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles. Tuesday night's telecast was held at the Nokia Theater, which is in downtown Los Angeles. A 4.7-magnitude earthquake struck the area shortly before 8:40 p.m. Sunday.

These finalists, chosen through a series of elimination rounds, showcase their vocal talents in the hopes of winning the coveted title and launching their music careers. LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Perhaps Ryan Seacrest said it best at the top of the ""American Idol"" Tuesday night when describing Adam Lambert and Kris Allen, the show's final showdown between the two contestants. In this corner: Kris Allen, the guy next door. ""It is the battle of the acoustic rocker versus the glam rocker. Conway (Arkansas) versus California. The guy next door versus the guy-liner."" After three performances apiece and plenty of judge feedback, it seems that the Southern California glam-rocker Adam Lambert has the edge -- but it didn't look that way early in Tuesday's show. In the first round, where the contestants chose a song from a favorite past performance this season, Simon Cowell declared Kris Allen the winner after his rendition of ""Ain't No Sunshine"" on piano. Watch Allen and Lambert talk after the show » Lambert chose to sing ""Mad World"" while wearing a long black coat and walking around a stage filled with white smoke, all of which Cowell found ""over-theatrical."" ""I think 'Mad World' is kind of symbolic,"" Lambert told reporters after the show. ""It talks about people who don't feel like they fit in."" Round two featured a tune hand-picked by ""American Idol"" creator Simon Fuller, where Lambert ditched the black overcoat and belted out Sam Cooke's ""A Change Is Gonna Come"" while sporting a shiny silver suit. Paula Abdul told Lambert ""it was the best I've ever heard you sing, ever!"" Allen's feedback after singing Marvin Gaye's classic ""What's Goin' On"" in the second round was much less flattering. See the best and worst performances from season eight » ""I thought it was too laid back for a night like this,"" said Cowell. He then gave round two to Lambert. Round three featured a bit of a twist -- both contestants had to sing a song co-written by judge Kara DioGuardi called ""No Boundaries."" Lambert went first and had little difficulty with the ballad. Cowell told the 27-year-old afterward that ""you have been one of the best, most original contestants we've ever had on the show."" Allen, however, struggled to stay in tune during the entire performance ... but the judges were less harsh this time. ""You have thoroughly, thoroughly deserved to be standing on that stage tonight, congratulations,"" said Cowell. Watch anchors debate ""Idol"" finalists » After the show, Lambert told reporters that they did not have a lot of time to work on ""No Boundaries"" and it was kind of a ""rush job."" ""There was a lot of lyric, and it was a big song,"" said Lambert. ""But it's a beautiful song."" It almost seems appropriate that these two are facing off in the finale. According to Allen, he and Lambert were once roommates during the competition. They even critique each other's rehearsals. ""He's always giving me stuff to change about mine ... to make it better,"" Allen told reporters. iReport.com: Who should win: Kris or Adam? A little over an hour before the show began, a magnitude 4.0 quake aftershock hit 10 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles.

464,"(CNN) -- Two Swedish journalists who were found guilty in Ethiopia of supporting terrorism were sentenced to 11 years in jail Tuesday, the Swedish Foreign Ministry said. ""Our belief was that the court would think they were journalists and they would be released. This is what the prime minister has said before,"" ministry spokesman Anders JÃ¶rle said. ""It is not fair that they are sentenced since they are journalists on a journalistic mission."" ""They are innocent and have been convicted because of their journalistic work,"" said Tomas Olsson, the journalists' Swedish attorney. ""We are very disappointed."" A court convicted Johan Persson and Martin Schibbye last week. Ethiopian troops captured Persson and Schibbye in July during an exchange of gunfire with a rebel group in the Ogaden, a prohibited region along the nation's border with Somalia, according to state media. Ethiopian officials accused the journalists of being accomplices to terrorism after the government declared the Ogaden National Liberation Front a terrorist group in June. Olsson said the 11-year sentence was the lowest possible one for the crimes they were convicted of. ""The prosecutor sought 18 years imprisonment, so if you look at it that way, it is a positive thing that they got the lowest possible sentence,"" Olsson said. ""But since they are innocent, they are very disappointed."" Schibbye and Persson have until January 10 to decide if they want to appeal -- a process that could take up to two years -- or if they want to seek a pardon. However, Olsson said, if they want to apply for a pardon the two have to admit the crimes, ""and since they are not guilty then this is not something they'd want to do."" Fredric Alm at the Sweden-based photojournalism agency Kontinent, for which the two men work, said they ""have a very hard decision ahead of them"" in considering whether to appeal or ask for a pardon, but that an 11-year sentence in an Ethiopian prison ""could effectively be a death sentence for them."" Alm added: ""The purpose of this verdict is to scare away all journalists from reporting in the Ogaden. But as journalists we have to continue reporting from closed areas. It's a very sad day for press freedom. It's a very sad day but it didn't come as a surprise for us. It's still a political verdict; it's not a real trial.

Persson and Schibbye were convicted on two counts: entering the country illegally and providing assistance to a terrorist organization, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). Press freedom groups say the two were embedded with the rebels while working on a story about the region. Journalists and aid workers are prohibited from entering the Ogaden, where human rights organizations say human rights abuses against ethnic Somalis by rebels and Ethiopian troops are rampant. ""The Ethiopian army's answer to the rebels has been to viciously attack civilians in the Ogaden,"" said Georgette Ganon of Human Rights Watch. ""These widespread and systematic atrocities amount to crimes against humanity."" Reporters Without Borders criticized the court's decision.

A jury found Green guilty of a raping a 14-year-old girl, then killing her and setting her body on fire to destroy evidence. Green also was found guilty of killing the girl's parents and 6-year-old sister. Green might become the first former U.S. soldier to face the death penalty for war crimes before a civilian court, where he was tried because he had been discharged from the military before his crimes came to light. Four other former soldiers are in prison for their roles in the crimes and the cover-up that followed. His lawyers offered testimony Tuesday from a psychiatrist who testified that a mental health review ""did not meet acceptable mental health standards."" Dr. Pablo Stewart testified that a military nurse-practitioner who examined Green some three months before the crimes ""had the answers in front of her that clearly marks all the symptoms of acute stress disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder."" Yet rather than pull Green out of combat or follow up with additional care, Stewart testified, the nurse-practitioner prescribed sleeping pills and sent Green back to his traffic checkpoint in an area known as the ""Triangle of Death,"" one of the bloodiest areas of the Sunni-led insurgency. Earlier, defense lawyers had identified the nurse practitioner as Lt. Col. Karen Marrs, and she was called by the defense to testify. She described Green's company as having the worst morale she'd ever seen, and she said the entire battalion was ""red,"" meaning it was ""mission incapable"" -- the troops were ""hostile, vengeful and needed increased control and command,"" without which there was a greater likelihood of misconduct. The psychiatric nurse said it was important for soldiers to return to duty, not only to keep up troop numbers, but also because ""soldiers evacuated prematurely have a hard time fitting in."" Marrs said procedures were followed, but it was difficult to keep precise records partly because soldier interviews took place under difficult conditions, in one case in a concrete structure that had a hole in the ceiling from a mortar shell. She said troops often were counseled that ""having sad and angry feelings are common,"" and that ""you aren't a monster for having these thoughts in monstrous conditions."" At the time of Green's arrest, he told FBI agents, ""You probably think I'm a monster."" Throughout the testimony Tuesday, Green repeatedly glanced at the jury. He appeared pale, wearing a light-blue button-down shirt and pressed khakis. He smiled at times while talking to his lawyers. He seemed moved by the testimony of his uncle, Greg Simolke, who broke down several times while speaking about his nephew. ""(Steve) was one of these kids, everyone knows them, no matter what they do, nothing works out, like he had a black cloud hanging over him,"" Simolke said. Green lived with his uncle, an obstetrician, in North Carolina for a few months during his senior year in high school, according to testimony. He moved back to Midland, Texas, where he was originally from, after a school counselor told him he was so far behind that he would have to take sophomore-level courses. ""I don't know if any of us realized how far behind he was,"" said Simolke, who went on to describe how proud he was when his nephew finished his military training. ""To me, that was a huge accomplishment for Steve,"" Simolke said before breaking down in tears.

471,"(CNN) -- Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo has revealed that he believes seven-time Formula One world champion Michael Schumacher will come out of retirement and join the new Mercedes team. The German has been a consultant with Ferrari, for whom he won five of his drivers' crowns, since he ended his career in 2006.

473,"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- The Mexican government has apologized to the families of two students killed early Friday who officials initially said were drug gang members. Jorge Antonio Mercado Alonso, 23, and Javier Francisco Arredondo Verdugo, 24, were mechanical engineering graduate students at the Technological Institute of Higher Learning of Monterrey, the Mexican Interior Ministry said Sunday in its apology for the shootings. Mexican soldiers chasing criminals who had fired on an army patrol shot and killed the students, the Interior Ministry said. Some of the criminals had fled onto the college campus. ""The Mexican government expresses its most deeply felt condolences to the families,"" the Interior Ministry said in a release on its Web page.

On Friday, Mexican officials had said the two dead men were part of the criminal gang that shot at the soldiers. University officials also said Friday that all students were safe. That account changed Saturday, when Mercado's mother tried to call him after finding out about the campus shootout. When she couldn't reach him, she traveled to Monterrey, where she identified her son's body, said the campus rector, Rafael Rangel Sostman. ""I'm certain he is with God,"" said the mother, Rosa Elvia Mercado Alonso. The school's rector blamed himself for the mix-up in identities. ""I offer a public apology and take responsibility for having given information that ended up not being correct,"" Rangel said. ""I want to offer my most deeply felt condolences to the family of our two students and offer them our support in this difficult situation."" Both men were scholarship students, the college said. Monterrey is in Nuevo Leon, one of two states in northeastern Mexico where drug cartel members blocked roads with hijacked vehicles Thursday and Friday to prevent military reinforcements from arriving. The criminals also set up roadblocks in neighboring Tamaulipas state. Three presumed gang members and one soldier were killed in various skirmishes over the two-day period, officials said. The area, which borders Texas, has seen bloody fighting between the Zetas and Gulf cartels after a recent gangland slaying. Hours-long gun battles are common, and U.S. officials were recently forced to temporarily close the consulate in the city of Reynosa. Mexico has been gripped in massive drug-related bloodshed since President Felipe Calderon declared war on the cartels shortly after coming into office in December 2006. Much of the violence has taken place around Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas. There are no official government tallies, but more than 16,000 people are estimated to have died in the drug wars. The vast majority of the deaths are among reputed criminals, with some police and military also being killed. Relatively few of the deaths have been civilians. Even so, the United States and Canada have issued travel warnings, particularly along the border area. The Texas Department of Public Safety took the unprecedented step this year of recommending that students on spring break not go to border areas inside Mexico.

475,"UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- The United Nations is calling on NATO to do more to stop the Afghan opium trade after a new survey showed how the drug dominates Afghanistan's economy. Afghan villagers tend to opium poppies in Taliban-controlled Helmand province in April 2007. The report from the U.N.'s Office on Drugs and Crime shows the export value of this year's poppy harvest stood at around $4 billion, a 29 per cent increase over 2006. Despite Afghan security forces' efforts to curb the trade, 660 tons of heroin and morphine were trafficked out of the country in 2007, the report said. Opium is derived from poppies, and the data on cultivation was collected by examining satellite images and by assessments on the ground. The report said opium has accounted for more than half of Afghanistan's gross domestic product in 2007. InvestorWords.com defines GDP as the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time, usually a calendar year. According to the U.N. survey, about a quarter of the earnings from opium go to farmers. The rest goes to district officials who collect taxes on the crop, to drug traffickers and to the insurgents and warlords who control the trade. Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, urged NATO to take a more active role in countering the spread of the drug trade, which has increased dramatically since the American-led invasion to remove the hard-line Islamist government of the Taliban in October 2001. ""Since drugs are funding the insurgency, NATO has a self-interest in supporting Afghan forces in destroying drug labs, markets and convoys,"" Costa said in a written statement to coincide with the release of the survey. ""Destroy the drug trade and you cut off the Taliban's main funding source."" James Appathurai, a NATO spokesman, said coalition forces were equally concerned by the rapid growth in the narcotics trade. ""We share the U.N.'s concerns,"" Appathurai told CNN. ""Drugs not only poison people, but they poison economies and governments, and it is in everyone's interest to stop this proliferation."" He said NATO forces were providing assistance to Afghan police through training and transport but he said there were no plans to deploy coalition troops to intervene directly. ""The issue of whether we can do more is certainly a live discussion for NATO, but at the moment this is a matter for the Afghan government,"" Appathurai said. Farming of opium poppies has been almost eradicated in the north and west of the country, Appathurai said. However, he said, in the lawless southern provinces and especially in the Taliban stronghold of Helmand, poppy production was going on largely unchecked. According to the report, U.N. observers have noticed a proliferation of heroin labs in neighboring countries and along trafficking routes. Costa said the labs are dependent on precursor chemicals, like acetic anhydride, that must be smuggled into the region. He called for tighter controls in chemical-producing countries and stronger intelligence-sharing between Afghanistan and its neighbors. ""Drug trafficking is a transnational threat, and therefore national initiatives have their limitations,"" the U.N. drug chief said. Appathurai said the most effective way to curb the drug trade was tackling the insurgency head-on. He also said it was important to provide alternative work for poor Afghan farmers to encourage them to give up opium production. ""You cannot have eradication in isolation.

UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- The United Nations is calling on NATO to do more to stop the Afghan opium trade after a new survey showed how the drug dominates Afghanistan's economy. Afghan villagers tend to opium poppies in Taliban-controlled Helmand province in April 2007. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime's report indicates that the export value of this year's poppy harvest stood at around $4 billion, representing a 29% increase compared to 2006. Despite Afghan security forces' efforts to curb the trade, 660 tons of heroin and morphine were trafficked out of the country in 2007, the report said. Opium is derived from poppies, and the data on cultivation was collected by examining satellite images and by assessments on the ground. The report said opium has accounted for more than half of Afghanistan's gross domestic product in 2007. InvestorWords.com defines GDP as the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time, usually a calendar year. According to the U.N. survey, about a quarter of the earnings from opium go to farmers. The rest goes to district officials who collect taxes on the crop, to drug traffickers and to the insurgents and warlords who control the trade. Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, urged NATO to take a more active role in countering the spread of the drug trade, which has increased dramatically since the American-led invasion to remove the hard-line Islamist government of the Taliban in October 2001. ""Since drugs are funding the insurgency, NATO has a self-interest in supporting Afghan forces in destroying drug labs, markets and convoys,"" Costa said in a written statement to coincide with the release of the survey. ""Destroy the drug trade and you cut off the Taliban's main funding source."" James Appathurai, a NATO spokesman, said coalition forces were equally concerned by the rapid growth in the narcotics trade. ""We share the U.N.'s concerns,"" Appathurai told CNN. ""Drugs not only poison people, but they poison economies and governments, and it is in everyone's interest to stop this proliferation."" He said NATO forces were providing assistance to Afghan police through training and transport but he said there were no plans to deploy coalition troops to intervene directly. ""The issue of whether we can do more is certainly a live discussion for NATO, but at the moment this is a matter for the Afghan government,"" Appathurai said. Farming of opium poppies has been almost eradicated in the north and west of the country, Appathurai said. However, he said, in the lawless southern provinces and especially in the Taliban stronghold of Helmand, poppy production was going on largely unchecked. According to the report, U.N. observers have noticed a proliferation of heroin labs in neighboring countries and along trafficking routes. Costa said the labs are dependent on precursor chemicals, like acetic anhydride, that must be smuggled into the region. He called for tighter controls in chemical-producing countries and stronger intelligence-sharing between Afghanistan and its neighbors. ""Drug trafficking is a transnational threat, and therefore national initiatives have their limitations,"" the U.N. drug chief said. Appathurai said the most effective way to curb the drug trade was tackling the insurgency head-on.

481,"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Islamic militants have moved fighters to the Somali border town of Afmado in an effort to combat Kenyan forces who have entered Somalia, the militant group Al-Shabaab said Tuesday. The group said it viewed the Kenyan forces crossing of the joint border as ""an affront to Somalia's territorial sovereignty."" This move of fighters, which started Monday, comes after the militant group had threatened to ""come into Kenya"" if Kenyan forces did not leave Somalia. ""Kenyan troops have entered 100 kilometers into Somalia, and their planes are bombarding and killing residents,"" Sheikh Ali Mahmud Ragi, spokesman for Al-Shabaab, said in an online message posted on a jihadist website this week. ""We shall come into Kenya if you do not go back."" In response, the Kenyan and Somali governments issued a joint communique declaring Al-Shabaab ""a common enemy to both countries."" They pledged to work together to stabilize Somalia and cooperate in security and military operations. Kenyan forces crossed into Somalia to pursue Al-Shabaab fighters after the recent abductions of tourists and aid workers in Kenya heightened tensions in East Africa. Kenya invoked the U.N. charter allowing military action in self-defense against its largely lawless neighbor. The abductions are part of a ""recent spate of blatant attacks"" that are part of ""a changed strategy by Al-Shabaab calculated to terrorize civilians,"" the communique said. ""If you are attacked by an enemy, you have to pursue that enemy through hot pursuit and to try (to) hit wherever that enemy is,"" said Kenyan Defense Minister Yusuf Haji in a news conference that aired Sunday on CNN affiliate NTV. Al-Shabaab, which is linked to al Qaeda, has been fighting to impose its interpretation of Islamic law, or sharia, on Somalia. The group issued a statement Tuesday, however, denying responsibility for the abductions. ""These are mere suppositions unfounded in any solid evidence,"" the statement said. ""Kenyan authorities have been seeking justification for an aggressive incursion on to Somali territory."" On September 11, armed bandits broke into a beachfront cottage where Britons Judith and David Tebbutt, both in their 50s, were staying. David Tebbutt was shot dead while trying to resist the attack. His wife was grabbed and spirited away on a speedboat, and is believed to have been taken into Somalia. On October 1, pirates made another cross-border raid, this time snatching a French woman in her 60s from a holiday home on Manda Island where she lived part of the year. Earlier this month, gunmen abducted two Spanish workers from the medical charity Doctors Without Borders from the Dadaab refugee complex, about 80 kilometers (about 50 miles) from the Somali border. Kenya announced its new tactics days after African Union forces claimed victory against Al-Shabaab in the Somali capital of Mogadishu. The military said last week it had taken the remaining Al-Shabaab strongholds in the far northeast of the city. ""The challenge is now to protect civilians from the sort of terror attack we saw last week, as they attempt to rebuild their lives,"" said Lt. Col. Paddy Ankunda, spokesman for the African Union Mission in Somalia. He was referring to a suicide truck bombing in Mogadishu this month that left dozens dead. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility. Other Al-Shabaab attacks that week led to the deaths of at least 10 civilians. Federal and African Union forces have battled Al-Shabaab in the impoverished and chaotic nation for years. Many analysts believe the military push has severely affected Al-Shabaab, along with targeted strikes against organization members and the weakening of al Qaeda. Al-Shabaab said in August it was withdrawing from Mogadishu, and Somalia's Transitional Federal Government, backed by African Union peacekeepers, now controls most districts of the capital, the U.N. office has said. However, the group still poses a threat, Ankunda has said.","Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- To counter Kenyan forces that have entered Somalia, Islamic militants have tactically shifted their fighters to the Somali border town of Afmado, as stated by the militant group Al-Shabaab in their announcement on Tuesday. The group expressed that it perceives the crossing of the joint border by Kenyan forces as a direct violation of Somalia's territorial sovereignty. This relocation of fighters, initiated on Monday, follows the militant group's previous threats to invade Kenya if Kenyan troops did not withdraw from Somalia.

482,"(CNN) -- Remember the iPod Nano and iPod Touch? They'll be getting some feature and style upgrades, as well as some price-slashing, in the near future. Although the iPods were largely overshadowed by Tuesday's iPhone 4S news, Apple CEO Tim Cook also announced a handful of tweaks to Apple's iconic music-player line -- in plenty of time, of course, for the holiday shopping season. The new Touch, now the most popular iPod, will be available in both black and white and get a $30 price cut, to $199 for 8GB of storage, $299 for 32 gigs and $399 for 64. It will also run Apple's new iOS5 operating system, meaning its ability to run apps, surf the Web and the like will maintain its unofficial status as the iPhone-without-a-phone. The new Touch ships on October 12. The Nano, perhaps appropriately, is getting an even smaller update. The most fun change will be Apple's addition of 16 new clock faces for folks who use the tiny player's 1.5-inch screen as a watch. Our favorite? The iconic Mickey Mouse watch is now available, with Mickey's hands spinning around to tell the time. It's also getting a price cut, down to $129 for the 8GB version and $149 for 16GB. The runt of the litter, the 2GB Nano, goes for a mere $49. (Virtually free by Apple's standards, if still more expensive than some rival mp3 players with the same limited storage space). Totally lost in the shuffle (see what we did there?) was any mention at all of the iPod Classic or ... Shuffle. The two didn't get a single mention at Tuesday's event, just as they were left out in the cold at last year's iPod event. That's led to lots of stories in the tech press speculating that the clock is ticking toward the demise of the two venerable players. (You know ... even if this one, from The Unofficial Apple Weblog, was dead wrong). But Apple's online store Wednesday showed both devices still for sale. It's clear Apple wants to move completely to touchscreen and abandon the old-fashioned click wheel on the Classic and Shuffle (the Nano's click wheel disappeared last year). Time will tell how long the older devices last, although for our money there's still something to be said for the top-of-the-line Classic, with its massive 160 gigabytes of storage, as a repository for folks' entire music collection. Music and other media content got another boost Tuesday with Apple announcing plans that could move iTunes into the cloud. The iCloud service will now be integrated into the iOS 5 operating system. It will work with apps and allow content to be stored on remote servers instead of the users' iPod, iPhone or other device. Each device will get 5GB of free storage, according to Cook.

488,"(CNN) -- Ventures lead guitarist Bob Bogle, whose fretwork on such instrumental hits such as ""Walk -- Don't Run"" and ""Hawaii Five-O"" influenced countless bands, died Sunday in Vancouver, Washington. Bob Bogle (second from left) co-founded the Ventures, the highly influential instrumental band. He was 75. The cause was non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, according to Don Wilson, who co-founded the Ventures with Bogle in the 1950s. ""He had a special sound that nobody could ever re-create.

""A year and a half later, we had a number two hit called 'Walk -- Don't Run.' "" The group first heard the song on a Chet Atkins record. Several other hits followed, including ""Perfidia,"" ""Walk Don't Run '64"" and ""Diamond Head."" The group took the theme of the TV show ""Hawaii Five-O"" into the Top Ten in 1969 and later supplied background music for the series. But the band, which played almost solely instrumentals, was perhaps more influential for its albums.

Already this month 11 people have been killed by lightning in the U.S. The same week, a 33-year-old man was struck while jogging in Texas, a 70-year-old California woman was hit while doing yard work and a Kentucky man, 44, fell victim while waiting under a tree for a ride. They are among 11 people killed already this month by lightning strikes in the United States, according to the National Weather Service. ""Lightning is very random in terms of fatalities,"" National Weather Service lightning safety expert John Jensensius told CNN. ""We normally see a good amount of lightning in June, but this is unusually high. There really is no good explanation of why that's the case."" In the U.S., six out of 15 fatalities caused by lightning strikes this year took place in California, Texas, and Florida, while the remaining ones were spread across the South, Midwest, and West. No deaths have occurred in the Northeast so far, ""likely due to the cool, damp pattern we've seen in New England,"" Jensensius said. ""There have been less severe thunderstorms there."" Summer is the deadliest season for lightning strikes because of the frequency of thunderstorms and the fact that more people are outdoors. This week, the first official week of summer, marks ""Lightning Safety Awareness Week"" for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The agency's message is ""When Thunder Roars, Go Indoors."" That's because all the people killed by lightning in the U.S. so far this year -- and the 28 killed in 2008 -- were outdoors.

Hackers tap into personal computers all the time. But what would happen if they focused their nefarious energy on neural devices, such as the deep-brain stimulators used to treat Parkinson's and depression, or electrode systems for controlling prosthetic limbs? According to Kohno and his colleagues, who published their concerns July 1 in Neurosurgical Focus, most devices carry few security risks. But as neural engineering becomes more complex and more widespread, the potential for security breaches will mushroom. ""It's very hard to design complex systems that don't have bugs,"" Kohno said.

495,"Hanford Nuclear Site, Washington (CNN) -- The federal government has set aside nearly $2 billion in stimulus funds to clean up Washington State's decommissioned Hanford nuclear site, once the center of the country's Cold War plutonium production. That is more stimulus funding than some entire states have received, which has triggered a debate as to whether the money is being properly spent. The facility sprawls across approximately 600 square miles of south-central Washington, an area roughly half the size of Rhode Island. It was built in the 1940s as part of the ""Manhattan Project"" to develop the first atomic weapon during World War II. Millions of dollars and thousands of jobs poured into the remote area about 75 miles east of Yakima where nine nuclear reactors were eventually built. During the Cold War, Hanford was a buzzing hive of activity, eventually becoming the main source of plutonium production for the nation's nuclear weapons program. Decades of improper radioactive waste disposal earned Hanford the notorious distinction of being most contaminated nuclear site in the Western Hemisphere. Today, the Hanford site is a virtual ghost town and those involved in the clean-up project say they will need every dollar of the federal stimulus funds. There are still millions of gallons of untreated contaminated groundwater, hundreds of buildings used for plutonium enrichment that need to be torn down, and underground tanks that are full of radioactive sludge. The stimulus money will reduce the clean-up time by years, according to Jon Peschong, who oversees the federal project at Hanford. ""It was perfect work, ready to go for the stimulus package,"" Peschong said. ""Each day that passes the conditions worsen [and] the receipt of the federal stimulus money allows us to reduce the costs and also allows us to reduce the clean up footprint much sooner, years sooner."" The money is also created jobs for about 1,400 people at Hanford, including Joe Gill who manages a team that is tearing down equipment that is heavily contaminated by radiation. Despite the dangers of his job, Gill said it came just at the right time.

While debate continues over whether","Hanford Nuclear Site, Washington (CNN) -- The federal government has designated nearly $2 billion in stimulus funds to tackle environmental concerns at Washington State's decommissioned Hanford nuclear site, formerly the focal point of the country's Cold War plutonium production. This substantial amount of stimulus funding surpasses the total received by some entire states, and as a result, it has sparked a debate regarding whether the money is being properly spent or not. The facility sprawls across approximately 600 square miles of south-central Washington, an area roughly half the size of Rhode Island. It was built in the 1940s as part of the ""Manhattan Project"" to develop the first atomic weapon during World War II. Millions of dollars and thousands of jobs poured into the remote area about 75 miles east of Yakima where nine nuclear reactors were eventually built. During the Cold War, Hanford was a buzzing hive of activity, eventually becoming the main source of plutonium production for the nation's nuclear weapons program. Decades of improper radioactive waste disposal earned Hanford the notorious distinction of being the most contaminated nuclear site in the Western Hemisphere. Today, the Hanford site is a virtual ghost town and those involved in the clean-up project say they will need every dollar of the federal stimulus funds. There are still millions of gallons of untreated contaminated groundwater, hundreds of buildings used for plutonium enrichment that need to be torn down, and underground tanks that are full of radioactive sludge. The stimulus money will reduce the clean-up time by years, according to Jon Peschong, who oversees the federal project at Hanford. ""It was perfect work, ready to go for the stimulus package,"" Peschong said. ""Each day that passes the conditions worsen [and] the receipt of the federal stimulus money allows us to reduce the costs and also allows us to reduce the clean up footprint much sooner, years sooner."" The money is also created jobs for about 1,400 people at Hanford, including Joe Gill who manages a team that is tearing down equipment that is heavily contaminated by radiation. Despite the dangers of his job, Gill said it came just at the right time. ""I had managed a production warehouse facility for one of the largest companies in the world, [I] thought I'd be there for 20 years,"" Gill said. ""We laid off 8,000 people in three months and they closed down our plant, [and] those jobs aren't jobs you just read the paper and get.""

496,"(CNN) -- Ford is the only major U.S. carmaker that is getting by without U.S. taxpayer money. Mark Fields of Ford says consumer confidence is key to getting the auto industry back on track. GM and Chrysler, on the other hand, have been told the Obama administration they will receive operating funds for several weeks in return for undergoing significant restructuring. Mark Fields, executive vice president of Ford, spoke to CNN's Kiran Chetry Tuesday on ""American Morning"" about the company's plans and whether it will be able to continue without financial aid from the government. Kiran Chetry: So, Mark, your company is the one that's gotten by without federal money. Will you be able to continue that? Mark Fields: Well, our position hasn't changed. We're in a different position than some of our competitors, and we're not seeking emergency taxpayer assistance. Chetry: Right, but I'm saying in the future, how are you guys guaranteeing that you won't need to go to the federal government like your two competitors have and ask for some help? Fields: Well, we're going to continue executing our plan, which really involves decisive actions around transforming the business, but also bringing great high-quality, fuel-efficient vehicles into the marketplace. And we've been working this plan over the last three years, and we've been making progress. Clearly it's a tough time in the economy, but we are really focused on bringing these great cars and trucks to customers, getting our cost structure right.

You can work out new deals with the unions. But in the end, if people aren't buying cars or they can't get credit, how do you remain viable? Fields: Well, consumer confidence is the biggest issue in the marketplace right now. The good news is, our new cars and trucks that are coming into the marketplace are being well-received. Our retail market share has been up three of the last four months. We expect the month of March our retail share to be up again. But getting that consumer confidence is really important. And that's why today we're announcing our Ford advantage plan, and it's for any customer who buys a Ford, Lincoln or Mercury product, when they come into the showroom and buy their product, if that customer loses their position, we will pay their car payments up to 12 months while they're unemployed, to give them that peace of mind.

502,"(CNN) -- A lock break occurred on the Ohio River near Warsaw, Kentucky, on Sunday, stopping barge traffic for several hours as the Army Corps of Engineers investigated. The lock break stopped traffic on the Ohio River about 65 miles northeast of Louisville, Kentucky. The incident involved structures, and there were no reports of injuries. All traffic on the river was stopped in both directions at about 9 a.m. ET, Corps spokesman Todd Hornback said. By 8 p.m., an auxiliary lock was set up to start allowing the half-dozen blocked barges through. ""It's going to take more time, but we're keeping the river open tonight,"" Hornback said. The river is a major artery for commodities shipping, with more than 50 million tons of cargo passing through the affected area annually, according to a waterways organization. It was not known what caused the break at the Markland Locks and Dam. Engineers were going to the site, about 65 miles northeast of Louisville, Kentucky, Hornback said. The lock's gates are 1,200 feet long and 110 feet wide. A smaller auxiliary lock is 600 feet long and 110 feet wide. Watch traffic backed up on Ohio River » A lock is a section of a waterway, such as a river, that is closed off with gates. Vessels in transit enter the lock and the water level is raised or lowered in order to raise or lower the vessel to adjust to elevation changes. One of the broken portions is known as a miter gate, Hornback said. The Corps of Engineers, on its Web site, says a miter gate ""has two leaves that provide a closure at one end of the lock."" They are so named because the two leaves meet at an angle pointing upstream and resembling a miter joint, the Web site said, referring to a joint meeting at a 45-degree angle, such as the corner of a picture frame. A public policy organization, in a February 2008 report, graded the locks' performance as a D, ""based primarily upon risk of failure due to unreliability of miter gates."" The federal government allocated $10.6 million to install new chamber miter gates, according to Waterways Council Inc., which describes itself as an organization ""advocating a modern and well-maintained national system of ports and inland waterways."" Hornback said the work was scheduled for 2011, adding that it's unclear whether Sunday's break will speed that up. ""The risk is very high that a failure of the lock gates will occur, forcing traffic through the auxiliary lock for an extended period, causing huge delays and costs to the towing industry,"" the council said in the report last year. Engineers hope to have the river back open as soon as possible, Hornback said, but an exact time frame was not known. Some 55 million tons of commodities pass through the Markland Locks each year, according to the Waterways Council. The principal commodity passing through Markland is coal, which fuels numerous electric power plants along the Ohio River, and those plants typically stockpile only about a 30-day supply, the council said.","(CNN) -- A lock malfunction happened on the Ohio River, close to Warsaw, Kentucky, on Sunday, causing barge traffic to stop for multiple hours while the Army Corps of Engineers carried out an investigation.

509,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- New Haven, Connecticut, firefighter Frank Ricci, the lead plaintiff in perhaps the most controversial case involving Judge Sonia Sotomayor, said Thursday that Sotomayor's rejection of his reverse discrimination claim had undermined the concept of a merit-based civil service system. New Haven firefighter Frank Ricci sued after the city threw out results of a 2003 firefighter promotion exam. Ricci was one of a group of 20 mostly white firefighters who sued the city of New Haven after it threw out the results of a 2003 firefighter promotion exam because almost no minorities qualified for promotions. The 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, including Sotomayor, backed the city in the 2008 case Ricci v. DeStefano. The ruling of the Circuit Court was overturned in June by a 5-4 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court. The ""belief that citizens should be reduced to racial statistics is flawed,"" Ricci told the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""It only divides people who don't wish to be divided along racial lines. The very reason we have civil service rules is to root out politics, discrimination and nepotism. Our case demonstrates that these ills will exist if the rules of merit and the law are not followed."" Watch firefighters testify » Ricci also criticized Sotomayor's 2nd Circuit for disposing of the case in an ""unsigned, unpublished summary order that consisted of a single paragraph."" Sotomayor was not present when Ricci spoke. She left the session after concluding her remarks earlier Thursday. Sotomayor argued before committee members Tuesday that her ruling in the Ricci case was decided on the basis of ""a very thorough, 78-page decision by the district court"" and followed an established precedent. ""This was not a quota case or (an) affirmative action case,"" she said. The case was a challenge to a firefighter test that had a wide range of difference between the pass and failure rate of different groups. The city of New Haven, she noted, was at risk of being sued by employees who could show they were ""disparately impacted"" by the test. New Haven city officials, after a number of days of hearings, decided they wouldn't certify the test but would instead attempt to develop a test of equal value in measuring a candidate's qualifications without having a disparate impact, she said. The question before the 2nd Circuit, Sotomayor said, was whether the city's decision was based on race or its understanding of what the law required it to do. The Circuit Court ruled that it was based on the latter. Based on established legal precedent, the 2nd Circuit decided that the city's decision was proper under established law. The Supreme Court, however, applied a new standard, she said, based on a different area of law. If she were ruling on that case today, she said, she would be bound by the new standards set by the Supreme Court. Ricci was one of several witnesses who testified both for and against Sotomayor. Linda Chavez, head of the conservative Center for Equal Opportunity, which opposes affirmative action, argued that ""it is clear"" from Sotomayor's record ""that she has drunk deep from the well of identity politics."" It is impossible for Sotomayor to be a fair judge when she has ""shown a willingness to let her policy preferences guide her,"" Chavez said. Arkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel testified on Sotomayor's behalf, arguing that her opinion in the Ricci case was, in fact, an example of judicial restraint. It followed a string of legal precedents dating back almost three decades, he said. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg also testified in favor of Sotomayor, telling committee members that she is an ""independent jurist"" with a ""sharp and agile mind"" who would bring ""a wealth of unique experience"" to the high court.","The paramedics, who arrived promptly at the scene, claimed that they were able to save the majority of the injured people who were present there.

511,"(CNN) -- A crowd plunders buildings crumbled by last week's earthquake, hauling off water, food, candles and anything else recoverable. Suddenly, a pickup truck hauling a half dozen armed policemen squeals to a halt. The mob scatters as the police officers in military style camouflage fire shots in the air and apprehend a few stragglers, some with a kick or a punch. Such scenes occurred with increased frequency Monday in Port-au-Prince, the devastated Haitian capital, as frustrated survivors resorted to scrounging and looting due to a lack of relief aid. The rising tension raised questions about the ability of the Haitian National Police to maintain order and its tactics in doing so. While the United States is sending thousands of troops to assist in relief efforts, U.S. officials say the Haitian police are responsible for security on the streets, with backing from U.N. peacekeepers. ""The first line of law and order here is, number one, the Haitian police, number two, the U.N. forces,"" U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Merten said Monday. ""The U.S. forces are standing by to provide security as needed."" That seems to be an overwhelming task for the Haitian National Police (HNP), a force of about 9,000 that is the impoverished Caribbean nation's lone security apparatus. Latest updates | Full coverage National Police Chief Mario Andresol told CNN Monday that the department has been severely affected by the earthquake, with thousands of officers injured, killed or unaccounted for. The Port-au-Prince force of 4,000 has dropped to about 1,500, he said. Complicating matters even further, roughly another 4,000 ""bad guys"" are on the run, Andresol added, after the 95-year-old, badly overcrowded National Penitentiary in the capital collapsed and the inmates escaped. ""Today, we have double work,"" Andresol said, adding that the police department is bring in troops from other parts of the country. ""There are not enough, so we are trying."" Bill Clinton, the former U.S. president who is the U.N. special envoy to Haiti, said Sunday that 40 percent of the Haitian police force has reported for duty since the January 12 temblor. It was unclear how many other police officers died and how many were struggling with the overwhelming hardships from such widespread destruction. First formed in 1995, the civilian police force took over security from a disbanded military known for loyalty to dictators instead of the state, noted Brian Concannon Jr., director of the non-profit Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti. A lack of money and other resources over the years, along with continued instability including a 2004 coup, has left the police force under-funded, under-trained and full of former soldiers prone to operating outside the law, Concannon said. For example, he cited summary executions of suspected criminals as a problem since the 2004 coup, along with police involvement in gangs or other criminal activity. In addition, a dysfunctional judicial system undermines the ability of the police force to deal with chronic crime problems in Port-au-Prince and elsewhere, according to Concannon. High-resolution photos of damage | Google map Progress has occurred in recent years, as the government simultaneously tried to remove ""bad apples"" from the police force while expanding the number of policemen on the streets, Concannon said. ""Although the HNP's efforts resulted in significantly increased levels of physical security and policing effectiveness, in many cases the HNP could not prevent or respond to gang-related and other societal violence due to an insufficient number of officers and inadequate equipment or training,"" said a 2008 report on Haiti by Concannon's group. Now the earthquake will set back the reform effort. ""There's no doubt the Haitian national police took a significant blow in this disaster,"" U.S. Assistant Secretary of State P.J. Crowley said Monday. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told CNN on Monday that he would ask for an additional 2,000 U.N. troops and 1,500 U.N. police officers to bolster the 3,000 U.N. police and soldiers currently deployed in Port-au-Prince -- among the 9,000","(CNN) -- A crowd plunders buildings crumbled by last week's earthquake, hauling off water, food, candles and anything else recoverable.

""The first line of law and order here is, number one, the Haitian police, number two, the U.N. forces,"" U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Merten said Monday. ""The U.S. forces are standing by to provide security as needed."" That seems to be an overwhelming task for the Haitian National Police (HNP), a force of about 9,000 that is the impoverished Caribbean nation's lone security apparatus. Latest updates | Full coverage National Police Chief Mario Andresol told CNN Monday that the department has been severely affected by the earthquake, with thousands of officers injured, killed or unaccounted for. The Port-au-Prince force of 4,000 has dropped to about 1,500, he said. Complicating matters even further, roughly another 4,000 ""bad guys"" are on the run, Andresol added, after the 95-year-old, badly overcrowded National Penitentiary in the capital collapsed and the inmates escaped. ""Today, we have double work,"" Andresol said, adding that the police department is bring in troops from other parts of the country. ""There are not enough, so we are trying."" Bill Clinton, the former U.S. president who is the U.N. special envoy to Haiti, said Sunday that 40 percent of the Haitian police force has reported for duty since the January 12 temblor. It was unclear how many other police officers died and how many were struggling with the overwhelming hardships from such widespread destruction. First formed in 1995, the civilian police force took over security from a disbanded military known for loyalty to dictators instead of the state, noted Brian Concannon Jr., director of the non-profit Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti. A lack of money and other resources over the years, along with continued instability including a 2004 coup, has left the police force under-funded, under-trained and full of former soldiers prone to operating outside the law, Concannon said. For example, he cited summary executions of suspected criminals as a problem since the 2004 coup, along with police involvement in gangs or other criminal activity. In addition, a dysfunctional judicial system undermines the ability of the police force to deal with chronic crime problems in Port-au-Prince and elsewhere, according to Concannon. High-resolution photos of damage | Google map Progress has occurred in recent years, as the government simultaneously tried to remove ""bad apples"" from the police force while expanding the number of policemen on the streets, Concannon said. ""Although the HNP's efforts resulted in significantly increased levels of physical security and policing effectiveness, in many cases the HNP could not prevent or respond to gang-related and other societal violence due to an insufficient number of officers and inadequate equipment or training,"" said a 2008 report on Haiti by Concannon's group. Now the earthquake will set back the reform effort. ""There's no doubt the Haitian national police took a significant blow in this disaster,"" U.S. Assistant Secretary of State P.J. Crowley said Monday. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told CNN on Monday that he would ask for an additional 2,000 U.N. troops and 1,500 U.N. police officers to bolster the 3,000 U.N. police and soldiers currently deployed in Port-au-Prince -- among the 9,000 The Jamaican police force represents law enforcement and public safety in Jamaica.",The Jamaican police force represents law enforcement and public safety in Jamaica.,What does the Haitian police force represent?,"['""The first line of law and order']",1
512,"(CNN) -- Two people were found dead and a third person is still believed missing in a North Carolina food plant heavily damaged in a morning explosion, police said Tuesday night. Part of a collapsed ConAgra Foods plant lies atop parked cars Tuesday in Garner, North Carolina. Four people were in critical condition after the explosion at the ConAgra Foods plant in the town of Garner, CNN affiliate WRAL-TV reported. The explosion, reported about 11:30 a.m. Tuesday, caused sections of the roof to collapse. Search efforts for those missing were slowed by ammonia leaks and a fire that was not extinguished until afternoon. ""There was no warnings, no signs,"" Garner Mayor Ronnie Williams said. ""It all happened very abruptly."" At least 38 people were transported to area hospitals, said Jeff Hammerstein, district chief for Wake County Emergency Medical Services. Four burn victims -- two males and two females -- were undergoing critical care at the North Carolina Jaycees Burn Center, said Dr. Charles Cairns, director of emergency medicine for UNC Hospitals. The patients suffered burns that covered from 40 to 60 percent of their bodies, Cairns said. Police said recovery workers still were trying to get the two bodies out of the plant, which makes Slim Jim food products. The victims' names weren't immediately available. More than 300 people were in the plant when the explosion happened, authorities said. The cause of the blast was unknown, according to Garner police spokesman Joe Binns. Rescuers were crawling into the rubble -- sometimes in pockets of space less than 30 inches tall -- in attempts to access the two bodies and find the missing person, officials said at a news conference Tuesday night. The search crews were moving slowly in part because the building is very unstable, officials said. Video from the scene showed holes in sections of the roof of the 425,000 square-foot plant.

514,"(CNN) -- There is a region of the world where the weather is always hot and humid and it rains almost every day of the year. Sounds predictable, right? But weather in the Intertropical Convergence Zone, or ITCZ, can be volatile and dangerous. Air France Flight 447 went down in a volatile zone along the equator between South America and Africa. The Intertropical Convergence Zone, which circles the Earth near the equator, is where officials say Air France Flight 447 plunged into the Atlantic Ocean. While weather has not been cited as a reason for the plane's crash, the tragedy does call attention to the region. The ITCZ is a belt of low pressure that wraps around the planet. Clouds and storms form along it because it is literally where the winds of the world's hemispheres meet. High pressure in the Northern Hemisphere churns air from the northeast toward the equator. On the flip side, air is steered from the southeast by high pressure in the Southern Hemisphere. The winds that move this air toward the equator are also known as ""trade winds"" and converge in the middle of the tropics. That's where the Intertropical Convergence Zone name comes from. Here, air and water temperatures are typically in the mid-80s. The warm, moist air is heated further by the blazing tropical sun. Steamy air, coming off the ocean, rises until it hits cooler, drier air aloft, forming clouds and thunderstorms. These gigantic storms contain volatile updrafts and downdrafts that can move at speeds of 100 mph. The height of these storms also can tower to more than 10 miles in the air. Even if you stacked two dozen of the world's tallest skyscrapers on top of each other, they still wouldn't reach the tops of the biggest thunderstorms of the ITCZ. Former Air Force meteorologist Tim Vasquez wrote about thunderstorms over the Atlantic at the time of the Air France plane's disappearance on his Web site, weathergraphics.com. ""Based on the infrared satellite imagery, I was able to. . .estimate the altitude of the thunderstorms at around 51,000 feet,"" he told CNN in a phone interview. Vasquez himself has flown through the ITCZ at least half a dozen times. ""I remember flying from Guam to the Philippines, constantly weaving around the thunderstorms. Sometimes, though, pilots are forced to fly through them,"" he said. That's because commercial airliners cannot fly above 50,000 feet. In addition, ITCZ thunderstorms can merge with one another to stretch far and wide, covering hundreds of miles. The crew of Air France Flight 447 reported severe turbulence shortly before the plane disappeared. How did the plane break into pieces? » When it's not storming in the ITCZ, the weather can be completely calm, with little to no wind. This stretch of ocean was particularly dreaded by sailors of the 19th century, who named it ""The Doldrums,"" because its lack of wind could leave them stuck at sea, unable to propel forward. Despite these challenges and dangers, planes and ships successfully cross the ITZC every day, thanks in part to technology that has made it easier to see where the thunderstorms are. Here are some commonly asked questions: Can hurricanes form in the ITCZ? It's extremely rare for a hurricane to form near the equator. However, the ITCZ doesn't stay in one place all year long. In the summer, for example, it drifts more northward, where it's possible for tropical cyclones to develop from the thunderstorms there. What does the ITCZ have to do with the ""monsoon season"" in Asia? Since the position of the ITCZ fluctuates, the location of the heaviest rainfalls varies depending on the time of year.

516,"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Had this custody drama played out in the United States, Christopher Savoie might be considered a hero -- snatching his two little children back from an ex-wife who defied the law and ran off with them. A Tennessee court awarded Christopher Savoie custody of his son, Isaac, and daughter, Rebecca. But this story unfolds 7,000 miles away in the Japanese city of Fukuoka, where the U.S. legal system holds no sway. And here, Savoie sits in jail, charged with the abduction of minors. And his Japanese ex-wife -- a fugitive in the United States for taking his children from Tennessee -- is considered the victim. ""Japan is an important partner and friend of the U.S., but on this issue, our points of view differ,"" the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo said Tuesday. ""Our two nations approach divorce and child-rearing differently. Parental child abduction is not considered a crime in Japan."" The story begins in the Nashville suburb of Franklin, Tennessee, with the January divorce of Savoie from his first wife, Noriko, a Japanese native.

TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Had this custody drama played out in the United States, Christopher Savoie might be considered a hero -- snatching his two little children back from an ex-wife who defied the law and ran off with them. A Tennessee court awarded Christopher Savoie custody of his son, Isaac, and daughter, Rebecca. However, this narrative takes place 7,000 miles away in Fukuoka, a Japanese city, without any influence from the U.S. legal system.

Dr. Albert Reiter, who treated Kerstin, is confident Kerstin will make a full recovery in time. She and other children who were held captive for years are slowly adapting to modern life, they said. Kerstin Fritzl, whom doctors placed in an artificial coma after she was admitted to a hospital in April for multiple organ failure, is now well enough to speak, stand and walk with assistance, her doctors said. Doctors said that ""little novelties"" such as seeing a cloud go by are now big events for the former captives. Kerstin has said she wants to see the ocean and go to a concert by British singer Robbie Williams, said Dr. Berhold Kepplinger, director of the clinic where the family is living. He described how excited Kerstin was to hear Robbie Williams songs in her hospital room and said she was moving around to the music so much that doctors had to quiet her down.

Police say he confessed to holding Elisabeth captive since 1984 and raping her repeatedly, fathering seven children with her. Six of the children survived. Kerstin fell unconscious in April, and Elisabeth convinced her father that she needed urgent medical attention. Kerstin was admitted to a hospital in Amstetten, where staff grew suspicious and called police, who opened an investigation and uncovered the abuse. Kerstin was suffering from kidney, lung, and liver failure when she arrived at the hospital, said Dr. Albert Reiter, director of the hospital. Doctors were able to turn her health around, but they kept her in a coma with artificial respiration for weeks, he said. Doctors started reducing Kerstin's medication May 12, allowing her to emerge from the coma, he said. Three days later, she opened her eyes and smiled at her carers, he said, and doctors were soon able to take the breathing tube from her throat. Her mother was at Kerstin's bedside regularly, and doctors credited that with helping Kerstin's health improve.

""It seemed to be kind of laid-back -- it didn't seem to be that dangerous,"" Leroy Carter, the stepfather who helped raise Johns since he was 3, told CNN affiliate WUSA-TV in Washington. ""He had wanted to be on the Metro Police force or places like that, but I would have rather him been where he was. ""But it just backfired.""

He remained in critical condition Thursday at George Washington University Hospital. Johns, a six-year veteran of the museum's security staff, was a resident and native of Temple Hills, Maryland. In the hours following the shooting, friends and co-workers repeatedly remembered ""Big John"" for his quiet, friendly nature. ""To look at him initially he was very intimidating,"" said Alan Burkee, a friend and former co-worker at the museum. ""But he was very shy. ... He had a great demeanor -- very pleasant, very courteous to all the visitors that came in and the staff that worked there."" Friends said Johns was an avid Washington Redskins fan and loved to travel, but lived just 10 minutes away from where his mother and stepfather raised him. He had an 11-year-old son, Stephen Jr., and recently had remarried, according to friends. ""He was a pretty great guy,"" Stephen Johns Jr., known as ""Little Stephen"" to family, told WUSA. ""He was always there for me when I was down or sad."" Carter had picked up Stephen after school to tell him the news of the shooting, and the two were on the way to the hospital when Johns died. Steve Maritas is organizing director with the International Union of Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America -- of which Johns was a member. He said the way Johns and his fellow officers responded Wednesday saved lives -- and it flies in the face of the stereotype of the run-of-the-mill security guard. ""If that was the case, there would have been 50 people shot yesterday,"" said Maritas, whose organization represents more than 30,000 officers nationally and about 5,000 in the Washington area. ""These guys are very highly trained, highly paid officers. It's not like they're just there wearing a uniform."" Johns had worked for Wackenhut Security Inc. since 2003. Maritas said Johns and his colleagues trained for days like Wednesday -- when years of safety and quiet give way to a sudden burst of terror. ""Hopefully, you'll never have to use your gun,"" he said. ""But you get a situation where you get a crazy guy like this -- it happens within two or three seconds."" For Carter, there will always a clear reminder of the stepson he raised as his own. Little Stephen, he said, looks and acts just like his father did at that age.

He had a great demeanor -- very pleasant, very courteous to all the visitors that came in and the staff that worked there."" Friends said Johns was an avid Washington Redskins fan and loved to travel, but lived just 10 minutes away from where his mother and stepfather raised him. He had an 11-year-old son, Stephen Jr., and recently had remarried, according to friends. ""He was a pretty great guy,"" Stephen Johns Jr., known as ""Little Stephen"" to family, told WUSA. ""He was always there for me when I was down or sad."" Carter had picked up Stephen after school to tell him the news of the shooting, and the two were on the way to the hospital when Johns died. Steve Maritas is organizing director with the International Union of Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America -- of which Johns was a member. He said the way Johns and his fellow officers responded Wednesday saved lives -- and it flies in the face of the stereotype of the run-of-the-mill security guard. ""If that was the case, there would have been 50 people shot yesterday,"" said Maritas, whose organization represents more than 30,000 officers nationally and about 5,000 in the Washington area. ""These guys are very highly trained, highly paid officers. It's not like they're just there wearing a uniform."" Johns had worked for Wackenhut Security Inc. since 2003. Maritas said Johns and his colleagues trained for days like Wednesday -- when years of safety and quiet give way to a sudden burst of terror. ""Hopefully, you'll never have to use your gun,"" he said. ""But you get a situation where you get a crazy guy like this -- it happens within two or three seconds."" For Carter, there will always a clear reminder of the stepson he raised as his own. Little Stephen, he said, looks and acts just like his father did at that age. Carter said he takes comfort knowing that the roughly 2,000 people visiting the Holocaust museum at the time of the attack were able","The Friendly Colossus, a gentle giant, played a game of chess with the townspeople, engaging with them in a friendly competition.",What did the Gentle Giant do?,"['opening the door for the man who shot him,']",0
522,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The sole survivor of the crash that killed Princess Diana has told a court he still cannot remember the incident but does not support the conspiracy theories surrounding it. Bodyguard Trevor Rees and the back of Princess Diana's head are seen shortly before the car crash. Bodyguard Trevor Rees, formerly known as Trevor Rees-Jones, was the front-seat passenger in the Mercedes that carried Diana, her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed, and their driver, Henri Paul. He sustained serious injuries in the August 31, 1997 crash and testified that he received anonymous phone calls and letters after the accident, threatening him to keep quiet. He said the caller told him to keep quiet, saying, ""We know who you are, we know where you are, and we know where you live."" Rees said he didn't take the calls or letters seriously. A lawyer also asked Rees about a supposed encounter with a woman in which he told her, ""If I remember, they're going to kill me."" Rees said he didn't recall the conversation and found it unlikely he ever made the remark. Rees, who still has a visible scar from the accident over his left eye, told the court he remembers nothing new about the crash, which, he has said, was an accident. He has said the last thing he remembers that night was leaving the Ritz Hotel in Paris, and that his next memory is more than a week later, in his hospital bed, when his parents told him everyone else in the car was dead. Rees suffered major injuries to his lower jaw, the base of his brain, and his pulmonary system and has had several surgeries and hospitalizations, some of which al Fayed paid for. Rees also testified that he did not support the allegations by Dodi Fayed's father, Mohamed al Fayed, that British security services were behind the crash. He denied the security services paid him to change his story. At the time of the crash, Rees was working for al Fayed's security team and was assigned to guard Dodi Fayed. He was also protecting the princess because she was Fayed's companion on the trip. He no longer works on al Fayed's security team. Rees has said what was once a good relationship with his former employer has broken down, largely because he does into support al Fayed's conspiracy theories about the crash. ""I am not a part of any conspiracy to suppress the truth at all,"" Rees testified. ""All I have ever done is given the truth as I see it."" In 2000, Rees published a book, ""The Bodyguard's Story: Diana, the Crash, and the Sole Survivor,"" offering his account of the events surrounding the crash. He said al Fayed tried unsuccessfully to stop the book's publication in England. Rees told CNN he wrote the book to give a definitive account of what he remembered and knew, but also to counter al Fayed's accusations that his unprofessionalism caused the accident. Rees also said proceeds from the book helped pay his legal bills. During the morning session, Rees testified that he had two flashbacks in the months after the crash, but his psychiatrist told him they were false memories. In the first, Rees said, he recalled hearing the voice of a woman -- apparently Diana -- calling out, ""Dodi"" from the back seat of the car. In the second flashback, Rees said he recalled seeing a paparazzi motorbike next to the car. Lawyer Ian Burnett then read from a letter written by Al Fayed to Lord Stevens, who investigated the crash for the British police. In the letter, Al Fayed says Rees is lying about losing his memory. ""He knows the detail which the security services are so eager to suppress,"" Al Fayed wrote, alluding to his belief that the crash was part of a murder plot.

523,"(AOL Autos) -- The conventional wisdom, among most folks, anyway, is that buying a used car is usually something done out of necessity, by those on a budget -- that is, people who want, or need, to ""move down"" from the new-car market because a new model is simply out of their reach. Bottom line, the Lexus reputation is for high-end luxury, quality and long-term dependability. However, there is another category of used cars that appeal to those with a bit more disposable income: used luxury cars.

524,"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's fear that promoters would ""pull the plug"" on his comeback concerts if he missed more rehearsals was unfounded, the head of the promotion company testified Tuesday in Dr. Conrad Murray's involuntary manslaughter trial. ""No one on our end was ever contemplating pulling the plug,"" said Randy Phillips, the head of AEG Live. Murray's defense lawyers contend Jackson self-administered the overdose of drugs that killed him in a ""desperate desire to get to sleep,"" because he feared without rest he would miss his next rehearsal and trigger the cancellation of his ""This Is It"" tour. Jackson's mother, Katherine, sisters Janet and La Toya, and brother Randy Jackson were in court to watch Tuesday's testimony. Earlier Tuesday, a nurse who tried to treat Jackson's insomnia with natural remedies testified that Jackson told her that doctors assured him using the surgical anesthetic propofol at home to induce sleep was safe as long as he was monitored. Jackson died two months after that conversation with nurse Cherilyn Lee, from what the coroner ruled was an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol, combined with sedatives. Prosecutors contend Dr. Murray's use of propofol to treat Jackson's insomnia in his home was reckless, in part because he did not have proper equipment to monitor his patient and he abandoned him to make phone calls. Phillips was the eighth witness called by the defense since the prosecution rested its case against Murray Monday morning. If the tour was canceled, Jackson would have to pay for all of the production and rehearsal costs, Phillips said, although the judge would not let him tell jurors how much that might have been. Defense lawyer Ed Chernoff estimated the cost to be about $40 million, leaving him ""a very, very poor man,"" but it was not while the jury was present. Concert director Kenny Ortega sent Phillips an e-mail five days before Jackson's death referring to Jackson's fear the company would ""pull the plug"" on the tour. The e-mail triggered a meeting with Jackson and Dr. Murray to address Ortega's concerns about Jackson's ""lack of focus"" and missed rehearsals, with the debut of his London shows just three weeks away. He and Ortega were satisfied when Jackson told them ""You build the house and I will put on the door and paint it,"" suggesting he would be ready, Phillips testified. Also at the meeting, Phillips told Dr. Murray that he wanted to make sure he knew about Jackson's visits to another doctor, dermatologist Dr. Arnold Klein. ""Because he's his principal physician, I thought he should know,"" he said. Phillips said he was concerned because Jackson ""seemed a little distracted and not focused"" in a meeting after a visit to Klein's Beverly Hills clinic. The defense contends Jackson became addicted to the painkiller Demerol in his frequent visits to Klein in the three months before his death. His withdrawal from the Demerol, which Murray was unaware of, would explain why Jackson could not sleep the day he died, the defense contends. Testimony from nurse Cherilyn Lee's was interrupted for 25 minutes Tuesday as she was overcome with emotion. ""I'm feeling really, really dizzy,"" Lee said. ""This is just very sensitive to me."" Lee and a Los Angeles doctor, both called as defense witnesses, testified that Jackson asked them for drugs to help him sleep in April 2009. This was after Dr. Murray had already agreed to work as his personal physician and placed his first orders for propofol. Lee, who used IV drips loaded with vitamins, ""sophisticated"" vitamin smoothies and bedtime teas, to treat Jackson's insomnia, said Jackson became frustrated with her natural remedies. ""He said 'I'm telling you the only thing that's going to help me sleep right away is the Diprivan and can you find someone to help me to sleep?'"" Lee said. Diprivan is a brand name for propofol. After some quick research, the nurse warned Jackson that it was dangerous to use","Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's fear that promoters would ""pull the plug"" on his comeback concerts if he missed more rehearsals was unfounded, the head of the promotion company testified Tuesday in Dr. Conrad Murray's involuntary manslaughter trial.

525,"NEW DELHI, India -- Police covered up the murder of a British teenage girl in Goa last month to protect the tourist industry, a state minister and local media said Monday. Scarlett Keeling stands on Anjuna beach in Goa a few days before her death. Officers had initially said Scarlett Keeling had drowned on Anjuna beach after taking drugs, but changed their story when the 15-year-old's mother protested and a second autopsy suggested she had been raped and murdered. A suspect in the case was arrested Sunday but Fiona MacKeown said she did not believe he was the man who killed her daughter. ""This is a clear case of murder and it has gone out of proportion because the police tried to cover it up,"" Francisco X. Pacheco, Goa's Tourism Minister told Reuters.com. Indian media suggested the cover-up was an attempt to protect Goa's tourism industry. ""They should have arrested this man a long time ago and this issue would have got diluted, but now because of the tainted image of some police officers in the case, things have gone out of hand,"" Pacheco said. Police said they were investigating allegations of a cover-up and the actions of junior officers. ""There are certain things under my scrutiny and I have taken cognizance of all these issues, specially these officers,"" Kishan Kumar, a senior police officer overseeing the probe told Reuters. Keeling's mother said she also believed police were trying to cover up the truth behind her daughter's murder, and that they had arrested Samson D'Souza, 29, to make it look like they were making progress in the case. ""We've had an awful lot of contact with people that have been in this situation before, and they've warned us to be careful (that) the police will try and find someone immediately to try and put a front on it that they're actually doing something,"" Fiona MacKeown told BBC radio on Monday. Kumar described D'Souza as a ""local Anjuna boy"" who was a bartender at Liu's, a beachfront bar. He said police had confirmed D'Souza's role in Keeling's rape and were now trying to find evidence that he killed the teenager. ""We have sufficient evidence to show that he was involved in rape,"" Kumar told CNN. ""So far as murder is concerned, we are investigating further.""

526,"(CNN) -- Two Russian bombers have landed at a Venezuelan airfield, from which they will carry out training flights for several days, the Russian Defense Ministry said Wednesday. Russia's Tupolev TU-160, pictured here in 2003, is a long-range strategic bomber.

535,"(CNN) -- When animal rights activist Jasmin Singer found herself face to face with a scientist who conducts animal testing, a cupcake was exchanged instead of harsh words. ""A good vegan cupcake has the power to transform everything for the better,"" Singer said. ""It's almost like a political statement with icing."" Singer was co-hosting a vegan bake sale in New York last week as part of the second annual Worldwide Vegan Bake Sale. More than 120 groups across six continents are holding vegan bake sales from April 24 through May 2. Bake sale participants see the sweet treats as a way to introduce those unfamiliar with a vegan diet to some of the flavorful foods they can eat. While vegetarians stay away from meat but may consume dairy and eggs, vegans give up all animal products. Some people become vegan for animal welfare reasons. Others view it as a way to reduce their carbon footprint. Still others choose the plant-based diet as part of a healthier lifestyle. Ruxandra Costescu, of Bucharest, Romania, said most attendees at the bake sales she helped organize weren't vegan. One person who showed up couldn't decide what he wanted, so he took one of everything, she said, adding that he came back later to buy more of his favorites for his family. ""It's really nice to have people who eat anything really appreciate the vegan treats,"" Costescu said. ""Usually people are amazed that they're so tasty."" In Sydney, Australia, Amanda Salles was inspired to start regularly holding vegan bake sales after joining the first worldwide bake sale last year. She has never gone to an animal rights rally, but she tries to make a difference by baking vegan desserts like gingerbread cookies. ""I know a lot of people probably think it's not enough or that you should be going to protests or demonstrations,"" she said. ""But it's a good way to participate. It's not very aggressive."" Some approaches to vegan outreach are less subtle. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has had half-naked activists campaign against meat consumption by covering themselves in fake blood and lying in human-sized meat packages. PETA's theatrics may seem a far cry from a bake sale, but the organization sees the sales and protests as means of reaching the same goal. ""Even if [people] don't like the medium that we're using to get things across, we really just try to make sure they understand why we're doing it,"" said PETA senior campaigner Ashley Byrne. Gary Loewenthal, director of the Worldwide Vegan Bake Sale, said he believes bake sales can be a nice change of pace for people used to more confrontational forms of activism. ""I liked it because it combined this time-honored, well-liked tradition with vegan outreach,"" he said. He started planning last year's event from his home in Falls Church, Virginia, after brainstorming fundraising opportunities with Compassion for Animals, the animal advocacy group he helps run. Loewenthal sent invitations to cities all over the world and soon generated a buzz online. In 2009, the event had close to 100 participants and raised more than $25,000.

536,"(Entertainment Weekly) -- After all the anticipation and hubbub, the weekend is coming to an end and the box office results are here: ""Watchmen"" (No. 1) grossed $55.7 million during its first frame, according to early estimates from Media by Numbers. ""Watchmen"" led the weekend box office, grossing $55.7 million during its first weekend. That's a solid sum, to be sure, although it's certainly on the low end of most projections. ""Watchmen"" premiered in more theaters (3,611) than any other R-rated movie in history, and it averaged an impressive $15,413 per venue, despite a potentially problematic long running time. It also scored the biggest debut of 2009 so far. Nonetheless, the movie's $55.7 million take (including $5.5 million from 124 IMAX screens) is substantially smaller than the $70.9 million that 300, the last R-rated graphic-novel movie from director Zack Snyder, earned on its opening weekend two years ago. And aside from that theater-count statistic (which almost any film could break at any time, really), there will be no major records to report on this weekend (for example, ""Watchmen's"" debut was just the fifth-best opening ever for an R-rated movie). I'd argue, in fact, that this opening is a bit soft, considering the great expectations that came with Snyder's adaptation of Alan Moore's landmark comic book -- not to mention ""Watchmen's"" hefty grosses from screenings at midnight on Friday and throughout its first day. After attracting some major initial interest, banking $25.1 million on Friday, the film's audience dropped off dramatically during the weekend: It grossed $19 million on Saturday and is expected to bring in just $11.5 million on Sunday. These are all big numbers, don't get me wrong, but, when combined with the fact that the film got a lukewarm CinemaScore grade of B from an audience that was largely comprised of older men, it all points to a rapid downward trend that may be difficult to reverse in the weeks to come. Elsewhere -- yes, there were other movies playing at the multiplex this weekend! -- a number of films continued to do what ""Watchmen"" must now aspire to, perhaps in vain: They stayed strong deep into their long runs. Tyler Perry's ""Madea Goes to Jail"" (No. 2) grossed $8.8 million on its third weekend; the film, Perry's biggest yet at the box office, has banked $76.5 million to date. ""Taken"" (No. 3) also moved along like the unstoppable force it has been for more than a month now, earning $7.5 million and bringing its six-week sum to $118 million. Best Picture winner ""Slumdog Millionaire"" (No. 4) was next with $6.9 million, which boosted its domestic haul to $125.4 million. And ""Paul Blart: Mall Cop"" (No. 5) took its eight-week total to $133.6 million thanks to another $4.2 million gross. iReport.com: What did you think of 'Watchmen'? Meanwhile, ""Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience"" (No. 9) completely fell off the map, dropping a staggering 78 percent to gross just $2.8 million. According to Box Office Mojo, that's the 15th biggest second-weekend decline of all time. Overall, the cumulative box office was up nearly 8 percent over the same frame a year ago, when 10,000 B.C. opened big, making this the fifth consecutive ""up"" weekend at the multiplex.

So when he wants to slow down, he heads to his hometown of Columbia, Missouri. NASCAR driver Carl Edwards grew up in Columbia, Missouri. He grew up in Columbia and couldn't wait to get out of town, but after living in North Carolina for three years, he was ready to come back. ""I realized after being away, there just aren't many places cooler than this,"" Edwards said. ""So I moved back, and now I live here and I'm really proud to live here."" He competes in both the Nationwide Series and the Sprint Cup Series for NASCAR. He won a Busch Series Cup in 2007, finished last year's Sprint Cup Series in second, and is fiercely fighting for Sprint Cup honors this year. Edwards has recovered from a frightening crash-ending to his last race in Talladega, Alabama, and is looking forward to racing in Richmond, Virginia, this week, hoping for his first trip of the season to victory lane. His fans are eagerly awaiting that trademark victory back flip. But through all of the excitement and acclaim, Edwards remains grounded and true to his Missouri roots. He took CNN home with him to Columbia -- which is between Kansas City and St. Louis -- to share some of his favorite spots. The day started at Rock Bridge State Park, 2,273 acres of natural beauty and serenity that is hard to believe is only 10 minutes from the bustling center of this college town. ""This park is one of Columbia's best secrets. It's a beautiful place to come mountain biking, hiking. There's a cave that runs under this ground that goes for over 50 miles."" The park boasts 15 miles of trails and endless possibilities for adventure, from hiking and biking to canoeing and even cave exploration. When Edwards gets the need for speed at home, he opts for two wheels instead of four. He grabs his bicycle and heads to the Katy Trail, just up the road from Rock Bridge Park. ""This used to be an old railroad, and now it's a state park. It's 10 feet wide, it's over 200 miles long, and all of this is open to the public.""

We'd shoot pool, eat booch burgers and just have a good time,"" he said. We were greeted by one of the owners, Charlie Kurry, who poked a little fun at Edwards' trademark backflip celebration.

The Pentagon has raised concerns about a March 8 incident in which ""increasingly aggressive"" Chinese ships harassed the Impeccable, an unarmed survey ship with a mostly civilian crew. China's government accused the ship of violating Chinese and international laws during its patrols, which took place more than 100 miles off the Chinese coast. ""The U.S. claims are gravely in contravention of the facts and confuse black and white and they are totally unacceptable to China,"" Ma Zhaoxu, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said after news of the incident emerged. Five Chinese vessels shadowed the Impeccable, with two of them closing to within 25 feet while their crews waved Chinese flags and stripped down to their underwear in a sign of disrespect. The Impeccable also turned fire hoses on one of the ships ""in order to protect itself,"" the Pentagon said. The Pentagon said the Chinese also attempted to snag the sonar equipment that the ship was towing behind it, leaving crew members discussing possible orders to destroy the equipment at one point.

547,"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- Air traffic controllers in Lebanon were telling the pilot of an Ethiopian Airlines flight to change course shortly before it crashed into the sea, the country's transportation minister told CNN Tuesday. An international search team was combing Lebanon's Mediterranean coastline for signs of life Tuesday amid fears that all 90 people aboard the Addis Ababa-bound airliner perished in the accident, authorities said. Lebanese Transportation Minister Ghazi al-Aridi said Tuesday it was too early to determine whether pilot error had caused the crash. He said the plane's flight data and cockpit voice recorders would need to be recovered to determine why Flight 409 disappeared from radar screens shortly after taking off from Beirut's Rafik Hariri International Airport at about 2:30 a.m. local time. The control tower lost contact with the plane before it made a course correction Monday, al-Aridi said. In a statement, Ethiopian Airlines said the pilot of the flight had more than 20 years of experience flying various aircraft with the airline's network. The plane had been declared safe and fit to fly following a regular maintenance service on December 25, 2009, the airline said. The Lebanese military reported Tuesday that 14 bodies had been found -- nine fewer than an earlier count. Confusion early in the search led to double-counting, they said. No survivors have been found. The search included aircraft from the United States, Britain, France and Cyprus. The U.S. military sent the USS Ramage -- a guided missile destroyer -- and Navy P-3 aircraft in response to Lebanese requests for assistance, according to U.S. defense officials. ""We don't believe that there is any indication for sabotage or foul play,"" Lebanese President Michel Suleiman said Monday. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board is also sending an investigator because the plane was made by a U.S. manufacturer. The Boeing 737-800 had eight crew members and 82 passengers -- 51 Lebanese nationals, 23 Ethiopians, two Britons and citizens from Canada, Iraq, Russia, Syria, Turkey and France -- when it went down, the airline said. The plane crashed about 3.5 kilometers (2 miles) west of the town of Na'ameh which is 15 kilometers (9 miles) south of Beirut. Government-owned Ethiopian Airlines is one of the largest carriers in Africa, serving Europe and three other continents. The airline has experienced two fatal crashes since 1980. In November 1996, a flight bound for Ivory Coast was hijacked by three men who demanded that the pilot fly to Australia. The pilot crashed while attempting an emergency landing near the Comoros Islands off Africa. About 130 of the 172 people aboard died, according to published reports. And in September 1988, a flight struck a flock of birds during takeoff. During the crash landing that followed, 31 of the 105 people aboard died.

550,"Fort Lauderdale, Florida (CNN) -- Just taking a sip of water or walking to the bathroom is excruciatingly painful for 15-year-old Michael Brewer, who was burned over 65 percent of his body after being set on fire, allegedly by a group of teenagers. ""It hurts my heart to see him in pain, but it enlightens at the same time to know my son is strong enough to make it through on a daily basis,"" his mother, Valerie Brewer, told CNN on Wednesday. Brewer and her husband, Michael Brewer, Sr., spoke to CNN's Tony Harris, a day after a 13-year-old boy who witnessed last month's attack publicly read a written statement: ""I want to express my deepest sympathy to Mikey and his family,"" Jeremy Jarvis said. ""I will pray for Mikey to grow stronger every day and for Mikey's speedy recovery."" Jarvis' older brother has been charged in the October 12 attack in Deerfield Beach, Florida. When asked about the teen's statement, Valerie Brewer -- who knows the Jarvis family -- said she ""can't focus on that."" ""I would really like to stay away from that because that brings negative energy to me and I don't need that right now,"" she said. Her son remains in guarded condition at the University of Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center. He suffered second- and third-degree burns over about two-thirds of his body, according to the hospital's associate director, Dr. Carl Schulman. The teen faces a lifelong recovery from his injuries, Schulman told CNN's Harris. ""Michael's still got a lot of major surgery ahead of him, a lot of rehabilitation and therapy,"" Schulman said. ""He's doing about as well as could be expected at this point in his recovery, but he's got a period of probably several weeks to a couple of months still left in the hospital if everything goes well, but the recovery is lifelong. This is truly a life-changing event."" Valerie Brewer said her son's treatment is excruciating at times. Physical therapy, she said, is ""incredibly painful. He almost cries because it's so painful. He's burned badly on the backs of his knees and every time he moves his knee, it pulls, and if it's healing, it pulls the scab and it cracks, and it starts to bleed."" The boy must undergo hour-and-a-half showers, she said, where ""they take a piece of gauze, and they wipe off all the dead skin. They give him painkillers for that, but it's incredibly painful and it breaks my heart every time they have to do it. ... That's what we call the torture hour."" Heavy metal musician Ozzy Osbourne sent Brewer a CD, and he plays it on a boom box during the showers, she said. ""He focuses on Ozzy, and he gets through his torture hour."" Police were able to interview Brewer on Monday for the first time since the incident. Hospital officials have said Brewer can communicate only in one- or two-word answers. Valerie Brewer would not go into details about what her son told investigators, but said that ""he answered the questions they asked."" The interview was emotional for both the teen and the investigators, according to Maria Schneider, a prosecutor with the state attorney's office in Broward County. ""It was difficult for him to talk about. Difficult for us to listen to,"" she said of the interview. ""Just difficult all around, heart-wrenching. He's doing so much better, but it's such a terrible situation."" Denver Jarvis and Matthew Bent, both 15, are accused along with a third teen, Jesus Mendez, 16, of being in a group that poured alcohol over Brewer and set him ablaze in a dispute over $40, a video game and a bicycle.

551,"FARGO, North Dakota (CNN) -- Forecasters issued flash flood warnings for Bismarck and surrounding areas Wednesday, as volunteers rushed to fill sandbags ahead of expected record floods in the flat state of North Dakota. Explosives are set off in the Missouri River on Wednesday to break up ice jams. Areas of three counties -- Morton, Emmons and Burleigh, which includes the North Dakota capital of Bismarck -- were under a flash flood warning until 12:30 p.m. CT (1:30 p.m. ET), the National Weather Service said. In an effort to alleviate the flooding, demolition crews blew up an ice jam Wednesday evening south of Bismarck, according to CNN affiliate KXMB. Mayor John Warford said that water appeared to be moving more freely in the Missouri River after the explosives were set off, KXMB reported. The plan is make sure water continues flow through the river channel and not spread out over land. Ice jams in rivers have been a major factor in the flooding there. Most of the state, which endured a particularly harsh winter, remained under a flood warning Wednesday, with forecasters predicting possibly record flood levels on several rivers. Snow, which continued to fall Wednesday, complicated preparations, city officials said. ""I woke up this morning and looked outside, I guess I thought of the same thing everybody else did. ... [What] came to mind is what a revolting development this is,"" said Mark Voxland, the mayor of Moorhead, Minnesota, a city just outside of Fargo.

The river is expected to crest between 39 and 41 feet in Fargo on Friday, according to Cecily Fong of the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services. The record for the Red River at Fargo was set in 1897 at 40.1 feet, according to Pat Slattery of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The threat of flooding prompted authorities to ask for volunteers to fill sandbags either to build temporary dikes or to bolster existing ones.

See images of flooding, preparation » ""There have been so many volunteers that we had to turn people away,"" said Ryan McEwan, a supervisor at one volunteer coordinating center. ""It is very busy. They are filling sandbags as fast as they can."" As of late Tuesday, Fargo residents and out-of-town volunteers had filled more than 1 million sandbags out of the needed 2 million. Fargo Deputy Mayor Tim Mahoney said he hoped that goal would be met by Thursday. Fargo's mayor, Dennis Walaker, said Wednesday that his city was about 95 percent prepared for the flooding, which is expected later in the week.

So said Oregon State Senior Trooper David Petersen after he was able to catch up with six exotic sports cars on a stretch of Highway 18 near Grand Ronde on Thursday, according to a news release. Perhaps a more amazing feat was that he stopped all the cars simultaneously. ""They just were all good little soldiers and pulled right over,"" Oregon State Police spokesman Lt. Gregg Hastings told CNN. One of the drivers was later cited again on a different highway. The drivers of the cars -- consisting of Ferraris, a Lamborghini and an Acura NSX -- told Petersen they were part of a group of 20 similar cars making an annual road trip, the news release said. They were all cordial and cooperative, and were cited with speed racing, a class A traffic violation that can command a fine of $627, Hastings said. After receiving reports Thursday morning that several sports cars were speeding and passing in no-pass zones west of Grand Ronde, Petersen set up east of the casino town, near McMinnville, and waited. Five of the cars soon blew past him, running about 100 mph in a 55-mph zone, Hastings said. As Petersen pulled onto Highway 18 in pursuit, a sixth car passed him. ""I guess when you're going too fast, you're in a rock and a hard place,"" Hastings said. Highway 18 runs from Dayton, Oregon, in the Willamette Valley to the Pacific coast. The stretch where the cars were cited is considered particularly dangerous and the Oregon Department of Transportation provides additional funding to enforce traffic laws there, Hastings said.

559,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Harry Patch -- the last surviving British soldier from World War I -- died Saturday at the age of 111, Britain's Ministry of Defence said. Harry Patch, pictured here on November 11, 2008, at an Armistice Day commemoration ceremony in London. Patch died peacefully at his care home in the southwestern English city of Wells, the ministry announced. His death came a week after fellow British World War I veteran Henry Allingham died at the age of 113. Patch was the last surviving soldier to have witnessed the horrors of trench warfare in the first World War He fought and was seriously wounded in Ypres, Belgium, in 1917 at the Battle of Passchendaele, in which 70,000 of his fellow soldiers died -- including three of his close friends. Born in 1898, Patch became a plumber before being conscripted to the army in 1916. After training, Patch was recruited to The Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry as a Lewis gunner assistant. The unit was rushed to the front line trenches of Ypres, where soldiers were urgently needed to replace those who were wounded and dying by the thousand. He fought in the trenches between June and September of 1917 and was involved in some of the fiercest fighting of the war. In late September he was wounded when a light shell exploded above his head, bringing an end to his military service. He received battlefield treatment without anesthetic. After the war, Harry returned to his work as a plumber and later became a sanitary engineer. He married Ada Billington, a young girl he met while convalescing after the battle. They married in 1919 and had two sons. In World War II, Patch joined the Auxiliary Fire Service and helped tackle the fires caused by heavy German raids on the English cities of Bath and Bristol. At one point, he was sent to organize sanitary arrangements for soldiers at a camp near Yeovil, where he became friendly with some of the men. Patch remembered the shock of finding the camp deserted, with coffee still hot and meals half-eaten, on the morning that the soldiers had gone off to France, the Ministry of Defence said. His wife, Ada, died in 1976, and their two sons also later died. Patch remarried in 1980, but he became a widower for the second time four years later. Patch didn't speak about the war until he turned 100, the Ministry of Defence said. ""He tried to suppress the memories and to live as normal a life as possible; the culture of his time said that he was fortunate to have survived and that he should get on with his life,"" a Ministry of Defence biography says. ""That suited Harry; he could 'forget' his demons, the memories of what happened to him and to his close friends."" In 1998, a television producer with an interest in the war talked to Patch, who then made the decision to speak of his memories, the Ministry of Defence said. He took part in a documentary on the war and began gradually to open up. It wasn't long before Patch became a spokesman for his generation, speaking about the horrors of the war as well as his own emotions and reactions, the Ministry of Defence said. ""In speaking about his experiences, Harry began at last to come to terms with his war, and was at peace with himself and his memories,"" the Defence Ministry said. ""His thoughts then turned to reconciliation, to the long-term effects of suffering and coming to terms with that suffering."" Patch returned to Belgium in 2002, something he had said he would never do, and laid a wreath to his battalion, the Defence Ministry said. Two years later, he met and shook hands with a German artilleryman from the Western Front, Charles Kuentz. Patch later laid a wreath at Langemark Cemetery for the German war dead.

563,"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- A third beluga whale belonging to the world's largest aquarium has died, the Georgia Aquarium announced late Monday. The exact cause of Nico's sudden death on Saturday is inconclusive from the initial necropsy or animal autopsy. The Georgia Aquarium hopes to find out more information in the months ahead from a more detailed necropsy. ""As we work with and care for the many animals at the Georgia Aquarium, we become attached emotionally,"" said Dr. Gregory D. Bossart, chief veterinary officer at the aquarium. ""The loss is not unlike that of faithful dog or special horse that has been a part your life for years."" Nico died at Sea World in San Antonio, where he and two other beluga whales had been moved temporarily while the Georgia Aquarium is undergoing renovation. Nico was scheduled to return home to Atlanta next month with companions Maris and Natasha. Nico arrived in Atlanta with Gaspar, two whales obtained from a park in Mexico. Both animals suffered ""significant health issues"" from their times in a foreign park and were essentially ""living on borrowed time,"" said Bossart, who had been caring for the two whales as far as nine years ago, while they were still in Mexico. ""We rescued Nico knowing that he had health issues due to his prior home, but we were confident that we could provide a better quality of life for his final years,"" Bossart said. Gaspar was suffering from a bone disease contracted before arriving at the downtown Atlanta aquarium and was euthanized in January 2007. Another beluga whale, Marina, died 11 months later from complications of old age. Beluga whales or white whales, whose name is derived from a Russian word meaning white, typically live in Arctic and sub-Arctic regions including Canada, Russia, Greenland and the U.S. state of Alaska. They can live up to 35 years. The belugas are not the only high-profile deaths at the Georgia Aquarium, which opened in late 2005. A pair of whale sharks have also died at the eight-million-gallon facility, the only one outside Asia to display the giant fish.

Garth Brooks played two secret concerts in Vegas earlier this summer. Now he's signed on for an engagement. Camera crews and journalists filled the front section. Executives flanked the sides. And then smack dab in the middle of the audience was a row of chefs, enthusiastically applauding in their toques and kitchen whites. Yes, the media was buzzing about the much-anticipated announcement, but hotel employees at the Wynn Encore in Las Vegas were equally excited -- maybe even more so, because of the part they played in persuading the country music superstar to enter into a five-year weekend residency at the establishment beginning December 11. This summer, as the media threw itself head-first into the death of Michael Jackson, the Oklahoma native quietly took the stage at the 1,500-seat Encore Theater in two hush-hush shows attended by hotel workers. One was an intimate acoustic performance; the other a concert with his full band. He sang. He charmed. He won over staffers who never thought they'd be caught dead tapping their toes to country music. And that, ladies and gentleman, exemplifies the uncanny ability of Garth Brooks to connect with human beings, and explains why he -- not Michael Jackson -- is the best-selling solo artist of all time in any genre. (You can look it up.) ""I think my gift truly is I'm an average guy. What I like, an average guy likes. It's that simple.

Sandy and I were getting a divorce at the time, so I couldn't expect her to do my job for me any longer,"" he said. ""We told the people that's what I'm going to do, and the people -- 99 percent of them -- said, 'Go. Go do what you gotta do. We'll be here when you get back,' and we'll see if they are.""

566,"(CNN) -- A grizzly bear attacked and killed a hunter Friday in a remote part of northwestern Montana before being gunned down itself, authorities said. The man who was killed had been part of a hunting party of three men, said Mike Weland, a spokesman for Boundary County, Idaho, which borders Canada and abuts the area where the attack took place. By the time the other two hunters -- one of whom witnessed the attack -- arrived on the site, the man was dead, Weland said. One of the victim's hunting partners eventually shot and killed the grizzly, according to the sheriff's office. Authorities received a cell phone call about 10 a.m. reporting the incident near Buckhorn Mountain, the sheriff's office said. Officials from multiple government agencies were at the site by Friday evening, Weland added a short time later in an e-mail to reporters. At that point, authorities determined that the incident -- initially believed to have happened in northern Idaho -- actually occurred on the Montana side of Buckhorn Mountain, according to Weland. Boundary County sheriff deputies remain on site, but jurisdiction was being transferred to authorities from Lincoln County, Montana. Weland said earlier Friday that authorities were talking with the two survivors and could see the attack site from a distance as they climbed. The sheriff's offices, the Idaho Fish and Game Department, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are investigating. The name of the victim, who was not from Boundary County, was not being released until authorities could notify his next of kin. The incident follows a series of bear attacks in recent months in the United States. Two men were killed this summer in Yellowstone National Park by grizzly bears, Park Superintendent Dan Wenk said. In August, a lone 50-year-old man was bit by a grizzly bear in Montana's Glacier National Park but was able to continue hiking until he found help, the National Park Service said. And earlier this month, two young campers were injured when they were attacked by a black bear at Stokes State Forest in northwestern New Jersey, the state's Department of Environmental Protection said.

The party also lost four Senate contests. The new composition of Congress could shift power away from Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, Kirchner's wife. Nestor Kirchner also lost a race for a congressional seat in Buenos Aires province. He lost his bid to Francisco de Narvaez, who leads a rival Peronist party, Union PRO, by a tally of 34.6 percent to 32.1 percent. The Kirchners' party also lost in some of the most important urban centers, including Santa Fe, Cordoba, Mendoza and Entre Rios. Argentina's ability to withstand the global economic slowdown was a key election issue. Economic indicators from Argentina look good, but there is broad agreement among analysts that indicators such as inflation are underreported by as much as half. An effort by Cristina Kirchner, who succeeded her husband, to tax agricultural exports led to a standoff with angry farmers who ultimately forced the government to backpedal. ""The Kirchners have been weakened by this latest economic crisis,"" said Robert Pastor, who was a Latin America national security adviser for former President Carter. The election could signal that the limelight on the country's most powerful political couple could be evaporating.

Suzan Hubbard, director of the Division of Adult Institutions, decided that Susan Atkins' request should not be sent to the sentencing court for consideration, said Terry Thornton, spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Hubbard's recommendation is advisory and will not necessarily prevent Atkins' release. The court -- not the department or the state Board of Parole Hearings -- has the final say on whether Atkins should be released, Thornton said. ""They're the only ones legally who can recall the sentence,"" she added. Atkins, 60, was convicted in the 1969 slayings of actress Sharon Tate and four others. She had been incarcerated at the California Institution for Women in Corona, California, but has been hospitalized since mid-March. Her request is now before the Board of Parole Hearings, which is conducting an independent investigation and will hear the case during its monthly public meeting, Thornton said. The next meeting is scheduled July 15. Atkins had been held for years at the Corona prison, which earlier determined that she met the criteria for compassionate release under the law, and sent her request to the corrections department. The Board of Parole Hearings will receive public comment, discuss the request in closed session and then announce its recommendation. The board also can decide whether to refer the request to the sentencing court. The court, based in Los Angeles, can either grant or deny Atkins' request. It also can recall her life sentence and resentence Atkins to a lesser term, allowing for her to be paroled. In 2007, the department received 60 compassionate release requests, Thornton said. Ten were approved. Citing privacy rules, prison officials would not disclose the nature of Atkins' illness. Her husband and attorney, James Whitehouse, has been quoted as saying she has terminal brain cancer, according to a blog called Manson Family Today. She also has had a leg amputated, the Los Angeles Times has reported. Atkins, known within the Manson family as ""Sadie Mae Glutz,"" has been in prison since 1971 and has been denied parole 11 times. She is California's longest-serving female inmate. Tate and three houseguests were slain in August 1969 by killers who burst into her Benedict Canyon home. A teenager who was visiting the home's caretaker in his cottage on the property also was killed. According to historical accounts of the murders, Atkins stabbed Tate, who was 8½ months pregnant, and wrote the word ""pig"" in blood on the door of the home the actress shared with her husband, director Roman Polanski. The following night, Leno and Rosemary LaBianca were slain in their home in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles. The two-day crime spree sent shock waves throughout Los Angeles. All of the killers remain behind bars. Atkins also was convicted in the earlier murder of music teacher Gary Hinman. Atkins, like family leader Charles Manson, received a death sentence. Her punishment was changed to life in prison when the California Supreme Court ruled the state's death penalty unconstitutional in 1972. Atkins is a born-again Christian, according to a Web site maintained by her husband. During her incarceration, the site says, Atkins has worked to help at-risk youth, victims of violent crimes and homeless children.

Susan Atkins is led from a Los Angeles grand jury room after her indictment in the 1969 ""Manson murders."" Suzan Hubbard, director of the Division of Adult Institutions, decided that the request made by Susan Atkins should not be sent to the sentencing court for consideration, said Terry Thornton, spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Hubbard's recommendation is advisory and will not necessarily prevent Atkins' release. The court -- not the department or the state Board of Parole Hearings -- has the final say on whether Atkins should be released, Thornton said. ""They're the only ones legally who can recall the sentence,"" she added. 

Atkins, 60, was convicted in the 1969 slayings of actress Sharon Tate and four others. She had been incarcerated at the California Institution for Women in Corona, California, but has been hospitalized since mid-March.

She said she does not expect enough additional evidence to surface for that finding to be revised. The remains were identified through DNA testing, comparing a sample from the remains to a sample known to be from Caylee. Some of the remains had been sent to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, for testing. The skull was found December 11 a half-mile from the home of Caylee's grandparents, where the girl and her mother, Casey Anthony, 22, lived before the girl disappeared. She was last seen in June.

It was the tallest skyscraper in Mexico City for many years. Now, it's kind of old but keeps its charm. If you're on Reforma, Mexico's most beautiful avenue, try to step into Piso 51 in Torre Mayor, the tallest skyscraper in Latin America. Beware: It is a private club, and you will be asked to join. Which restaurant would you take your loved one to for an anniversary or other special occasion? Taberna del León in Plaza Loreto offers traditional Mexican cuisine in a cozy environment. It's managed by Mónica Patiño, the famous Mexican chef. Where is the best place to people watch? Try barrio La Condesa -- its streets are full of bars and restaurants attracting a very interesting crowd, especially on nights and weekends. Also, you can go to Emilio Castelar, a street in Polanco full of life and good-looking people. What is your favorite neighborhood? Why? Colonia Roma is becoming the ""Mexican Soho,"" with lots of galleries, restaurants, bars, boutique hotels, fountains and squares. It is antique, so you can find old buildings, but it's also transforming into a more modern area. It is close to La Condesa, which is also a very cool place, full of young people. What's the biggest misconception about your city? You won't believe how many trees are in the city. And the robberies aren't that common, either. Where do you go to relax? Espacio Escultórico at the UNAM, Mexico's biggest university campus, offers a collection of sculptures by famous artists. That is a little farther south of the city. If you're not willing to travel that much, go into Bosque de Chapultepec's audiorama, where you can sit on a bench and listen to some good music. What essential thing should visitors see or experience if they have only a few hours? Go inside Museo de Antropología, which showcases the very DNA of Mexico. If you don't want to step into a museum, go downtown to see El Zocalo (Mexico City's main square) and Templo Mayor, the remains of an ancient Aztec temple. What's the biggest tourist trap?

""We're trying to empower the family structure, because if the family struggles, the soldier struggles. When the soldier struggles, it puts everyone at risk,"" Foster said.

582,"(CNN) -- Forget almost everything you ever thought you knew about the moon. NASA's latest missions indicate the moon is much more than a dead, unchanging satellite orbiting Earth. It's a dynamic environment, with changes occurring by the day and week, not over millions of years. The space agency says the missions are rewriting lunar science text books and revolutionizing what scientists know about Earth's closest neighbor. An announcement in November probably rivaled Neil Armstrong's first steps on the surface more than 40 years earlier: There's water on the moon. The Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite, or L-CROSS, and its companion spacecraft crashed into a crater at the moon's south pole in October and discovered water in a very dark and very cold place. L-CROSS researchers said about 25 gallons of water were detected in the crater, which measured about 60 feet wide by a few feet deep. Michael Wargo, NASA'S chief lunar scientist on the L-CROSS mission, said the probes detected more than water in the crater, but researchers are still trying to understand what the other stuff is. ""We're opening new chapters. And in fact, because some of this information is so new and it's so different from the way we use to think about the moon, there are chapters that are blank right now,"" he said. You know that they're going to written, but we don't even know the questions yet that are going to be engendered from this new information."" Wargo describes the lunar data as a treasure trove. The moon ""is like the dusty attic of the solar system, in that things get collected there and they give you insight, not just into the moon, but the evolution of the solar system."" Earthbound explorations, such as Lewis and Clark's historic journey to the Pacific Ocean in the early 19th century, carry critically necessary items, but they have no need to haul wood or water. That's not so for manned space flight. Those missions will have to carry all the supplies necessary for survival unless they can manufacture some of them either in flight or on a planet's surface. The presence of water and other compounds on the moon means there are potential resources that could sustain future exploration of the moon and beyond. NASA is also mapping the moon's surface in unprecedented detail, eventually creating the first moon atlas. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which launched last summer, is the robotic scout that is providing the data. LRO is on a mission that could last several years -- orbiting the moon and gathering crucial data that will help astronauts prepare for another visit. Wargo said LRO is carrying high-resolution cameras, which have now mapped about 50 areas on the moon, including the Apollo mission landing sites. ""We have cameras on board that have been able to image where the Apollo spacecraft landed, and you can literally see where they put down their scientific packages, where the astronauts walked on the moon,"" according to Wargo. The LRO discovered it's extremely cold in the permanently shadowed polar craters, where temperatures dip more than 400 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, or 249 degrees below zero Celsius. That's not far from absolute zero, defined by international agreement as 273.15 degrees below zero Celsius and a temperature that cannot be physically reached. These are the coldest temperatures ever recorded in the solar system. The LRO is also measuring space radiation on the moon. Astronauts will need protection from this radiation during expeditions to the moon and other destinations. All this information is critical if humans are to make it back to the moon by 2020, the the target date set by the Bush administration in 2004. But it's more than that. Wargo sum it up this way: ""We used to think of the moon as this really dead and unchanging place, that the moon was a dead planet. ...

PlanetSolar, the world's largest solar powered boat, recently stopped off in Hong Kong's Victoria Harbor as part of its 18-month journey around the world. Measuring 31 meters (102 feet) long and 15 meters (49 feet) wide, the catamaran is powered by 537-square meters of photovoltaic solar panels. On a sunny day they produce on average 94 kilowatts of power -- the equivalent to 127 horsepower. Seventy-five percent of the energy propels the boat that travels between 5 and 10 knots an hour. The remainder is used for everything else from flushing toilets to operating the boat's navigational systems. PlanetSolar is the brainchild of 39-year-old Swiss Raphael Domjan. While hiking in Iceland, the former ambulance driver was alarmed to see how quickly the glaciers were melting and decided to find a novel way to raise awareness of global warming. ""If we can go out on the road with this boat, it's a huge boat, only on solar energy, and we live on this boat, everything is working the computer, the telephone, everything is on solar energy. It means everyone can use solar and renewable energy at home everyday,"" Domjan said. Built in Germany at the cost of $26 million dollars, this vessel tracks the sun thanks to state-of-the-art solar technology. ""We can travel around three days with no light,"" explains Christian Ochsenbein, chief engineer aboard the boat. ""But usually there is light everyday even if it's raining. So when we come in a bad weather situation we can expand this time, we reduce this speed and we sail for about 5 days before we run out of battery,"" he added. Planet Solar set sail from Monaco in September 2010 crossing the Atlantic, the Panama Canal and is currently in the Pacific. Next stop is Singapore. It will then travel across the Indian Ocean and the Suez Canal before finally returning to the Mediterranean where it plans to dock back in Monaco in May next year. French captain, Erwann Le Rouzic (one of six crew members on board), says that while the technology has been faultless, Mother Nature has proven to be a challenge.

The remainder is used for everything else from flushing toilets to operating the boat's navigational systems. PlanetSolar is the brainchild of 39-year-old Swiss Raphael Domjan. While hiking in Iceland, the former ambulance driver was alarmed to see how quickly the glaciers were melting and decided to find a novel way to raise awareness of global warming. ""If we can go out on the road with this boat, it's a huge boat, only on solar energy, and we live on this boat, everything is working the computer, the telephone, everything is on solar energy. It means everyone can use solar and renewable energy at home everyday,"" Domjan said. Constructed in Germany for a cost of $26 million dollars, this ship follows the sun due to its advanced solar technology. ""We can travel around three days with no light,"" explains Christian Ochsenbein, chief engineer aboard the boat. ""But usually there is light everyday even if it's raining. So when we come in a bad weather situation we can expand this time, we reduce this speed and we sail for about 5 days before we run out of battery,"" he added. Planet Solar set sail from Monaco in September 2010 crossing the Atlantic, the Panama Canal and is currently in the Pacific. Next stop is Singapore. It will then travel across the Indian Ocean and the Suez Canal before finally returning to the Mediterranean where it plans to dock back in Monaco in May next year. French captain, Erwann Le Rouzic (one of six crew members on board), says that while the technology has been faultless, Mother Nature has proven to be a challenge. ""When you cross to the south of the planet you always find rain, strong winds and big waves, so we passed all this with lots of patience and humility, because you are always humble against bad weather,"" Le Rouzic explains. In every port, the catamaran and its message has been warmly received. It's hoped that the shipping industry, which is responsible for 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions according to the United Nations, will embrace this technology in the same way that the public has already shown enthusiasm for it. ""One day we won't have any more oil anywhere. Maybe it's in 50,100, 200 years but one day we will have no more oil and we'll have to find another way to live,"" Domjan said. And if Planet Solar completes its mission, the crew says that will be proof that the sun, and solar power, is the answer.","They will most likely reject the idea of adopting a new approach, as this concept seems to be unappealing to them. This resistance to change could be attributed to their familiarity with the current methods and a potential lack of understanding or trust in the proposed alternative.",What will they embrace?,['technology'],1

Cash for Clunkers is now working in more than 10 countries around the world. In Germany, consumers have junked more than 1.2 million guzzlers in the last five months and significantly boosted the economy there. So we know that Clunkers programs get the job done. How many other government programs can you say that about? The Senate has joined the House in passing an additional $2 billion for Cash for Clunkers, allowing the program to move forward. This will bring additional buyers to the showroom. One key feature of the Clunkers program is that it is not just $3 billion of new money into the economy. It is injecting $21 billion -- since consumers must bring the rest of the money to pay for the new car. That is a lot of stimulus for the dollar. Cash for Clunkers is saving jobs up and down the auto supply chain: from dealers to assembly workers and parts markers. Dealerships alone lost 50,000 jobs in the last 18 months and would continue to shed jobs without this program. If you look at the new cars consumers are buying with the program, 45 percent are from Detroit's Big Three automakers. That is a lot of new sales for Ford, GM and Chrysler. Cash for Clunkers also helps autoworkers across the country. Let's remember that lots of the Toyotas and Hondas sold in the program are made by American workers right here in this country. They are in states such as Kentucky, Tennessee and Alabama. This program helps all American autoworkers, not just those up North. Some people ask why we should help the auto industry and not other industries in this same way. Cash for Clunkers actually helps all of us -- even those of us who do not participate in the program or work in the auto industry. First, the auto industry has so many connected jobs in real estate, finance, manufacturing and other industries, that is hard to separate it out. Second, one of the biggest drags on our economy is our trade imbalance. We import about $700 billion more than we export. That hurts our capital flows, credit and other key indicators. Guess what amounts to 50 percent of that trade imbalance? Oil. We use 21 million barrels of oil every day in the United States and import 62 percent of that -- mainly from countries that really don't like us. We use that oil mainly for transportation -- cars, SUVs, and other vehicles. Unless we scrap guzzlers at a faster rate, we will never reduce our oil consumption. Cash for Clunkers is a step in the right direction. It educates the consumer on how much they are paying for having a low-MPG car and encourages them to get into a more efficient vehicle. A family can save $750-$1,000 a year by jumping just 10 mpg in efficiency. Those savings will increase as gas prices go back up. Gas has already shot up from $1.50 a gallon to $2.60.

590,"(CNN) -- South Africa inflicted the first home series defeat on Australia in almost 16 years as they wrapped up a nine-wicket win over the world's number one ranked Test nation in Melbourne on Tuesday. South African captain Graeme Smith led from the front with 75 as his team wrapped up victory. Captain Graeme Smith hit a fluent 75 as his side successfully passed a modest victory target of 183 on the final day at the MCG to take an unassailable 2-0 lead. It was the South African's first-ever Test series triumph in Australia and victory in the third and final match in Sydney will see them leapfrog the home side at the top of the global rankings. Hashim Amla (30 not out) scored the winning runs shortly after lunch as South Africa became the first team to overcome Australia at home since the West Indies in 1992-93. South Africa were never under any pressure in their run chase and did not lose a wicket until just before lunch when the inspirational Smith was trapped leg before wicket by Nathan Hauritz. Smith had dominated a 121-run opening stand with Neil McKenzie, hitting 10 boundaries. McKenzie struggled to a half century and survived strong lbw shouts from Brett Lee, who was bowling despite an injured foot that will keep him out of the Sydney Test. South Africa's victory was set up by a brilliant maiden Test century from JP Duminy, who shared a stunning 180-run ninth wicket partnership with pace bowler Dale Steyn. It gave the tourists a priceless 65-run lead on first innings before man of the match Steyn worked his magic with the ball as Australia were bowled out on the fourth day for 247 in their second innings. The pugnacious Smith was virtually lost for words in his victory speech. ""It has been such a special moment for all of us, it has been an incredible team effort,"" he said. ""I have been smiling non-stop since we hit the winning runs. ""To be 2-0 up after this game was something we only dreamt of."" South Africa won the first Test in Perth from an unlikely position, chasing 414 for victory for the loss of only four wickets.","(CNN) -- South Africa inflicted the first home series defeat on Australia in almost 16 years as they wrapped up a nine-wicket triumph, securing a win over the world's number one ranked Test nation in Melbourne on Tuesday.

591,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A portrait painted 400 years ago and kept anonymously in an Irish home for much of the time since is now believed to be the only painting of William Shakespeare created during his lifetime. The portrait of William Shakespeare is thought to be the ""only"" portrait painted during his lifetime. The image reveals a wealthy Shakespeare of high social status, contradicting the popular view of a struggling playwright of humble status, according to Stanley Wells, a professor who chairs London's Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. Wells, a distinguished Shakespeare scholar, arranged for three years of research and scientific testing which confirmed it was painted around 1610, when Shakespeare would have been 46 years old. ""A rather young looking 46, it has to be said,"" Wells said. Shakespeare died in 1616. The Cobbe portrait -- named after the Irish family that owns the painting -- shows Shakespeare with rosy cheeks, a full head of hair, and a reddish brown beard. The most common portrait of Shakespeare is a gray image showing a bald Bard with a small mustache and beard, and bags under his eyes. The identity of the man in the portrait was lost over the centuries -- until Alec Cobbe saw a portrait from Washington's Folger Shakespeare Library. That painting, which fell into disfavor as a Shakespeare portrait about 70 years ago, turned out to be one of four copies of Cobbe's portrait. The portrait ""shows a man wearing expensive costuming, including a very beautifully painted ruff of Italian lacework which would have been very expensive,"" Wells said. ""It establishes, for me, that Shakespeare in his later years was a rather wealthy, a rather well affluent member of aristocratic circles in the society of his time,"" Wells said. ""There's been too much of a tendency to believe that Shakespeare, being the son of a glover, coming for a small town in the middle of England, that he necessarily retained a rather humble status throughout his life."" Wells reads even more into what he sees in Shakespeare's newly-found face. ""I think it's plausible as a portrait as a good listener, of somebody who would have been capable of writing the plays, clearly the face of a man of high intelligence,"" he said. ""It's the face of a man, I think, who betrays a good deal of wisdom in his features. But, of course, as somebody (King Duncan) says in Shakespeare's story Macbeth, 'there's no art to find the mind's construction in the face.'"" It should be noted that Shakespeare's King Duncan paid a price for judging Macbeth to have the face of an honorable man. Macbeth later murdered the king. The public can read Shakespeare's face from the original painting at Shakespeare Birthplace Trust in Stratford-upon-Avon where it goes on display for several months starting April 23.

595,"(CNN) -- Intensifying violence, food shortages and widespread drought are driving an increasing number of Somalis to seek asylum in Yemen, the United Nations' refugee agency said Tuesday. A man brandishes a knife while others carry old notes during a demonstration against record-high inflation. More than 15,000 refugees have arrived in the Yemeni port city of Aden since January, compared with 7,166 people in the first four months of 2007, according to a spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Many of those seeking asylum brave treacherous boat trips across the Gulf of Aden. Consequently, the number of boats landing in Aden has jumped from 60 to 361 since January while the number of fatalities has remained constant, according to UNHCR. The agency attributed the surge to strife in Somalia, where riots continued in the capital city of Mogadishu for the second day Tuesday. According to news reports, Somali soldiers killed at least two people Monday during the protests over rising food prices. Watch protesters take to the streets » Somali refugees pay as much as $150 to cross the Gulf of Aden in search of asylum. Because of its proximity to the war-torn country, Yemen is a common destination for Somalis fleeing economic hardship, famine and war. Yemen is also an attractive location because Somalis receive automatic refugee status in the fellow Muslim country. New smuggling routes across the Red Sea have also led to increased numbers of refugees in Yemen, according to the UNHCR. Refugees often die before reaching Yemen because of dangerous sea conditions and overcrowded vessels. Others die at the hands of their smugglers, who order the passengers to jump overboard when the Yemeni coast guard approaches the vessel. Yemen's coast guard stepped up patrols of its coastline this year in an attempt to deter smugglers, according to the UNHCR, which operates shelters and reception centers for refugees in Yemen.

596,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano apologized Friday for a department assessment that suggested returning combat veterans could be recruited by right-wing extremist groups. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano says she offered her ""sincere apologies for any offense."" She met with American Legion National Commander David Rehbein at Homeland Security headquarters. ""The secretary started the meeting with an apology to me personally, to the American Legion and to the entire veterans community,"" Rehbein told reporters after the meeting. In a statement issued by the department, Napolitano said, ""We connected meaningfully about the important issues that have emerged over recent days, and I offered him my sincere apologies for any offense to our veterans caused by this report. ... I pledge that the department has fixed the internal process that allowed this document to be released before it was ready."" The report was an unclassified assessment sent to law enforcement agencies. It was titled ""Rightwing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment."" The mention of combat veterans surfaced on a conservative radio program earlier this month, and it drew the scorn of commentators and conservative members of Congress. Rep. John Carter, R -Texas, called on Napolitano to resign. Rehbein said Friday it is time to move forward. ""In the mind of the American Legion, I think her apology was sufficient,"" he said. ""The way the Vietnam veterans were treated once they came home, that's what drives the sensitivity to this, because those things start small and then grow from there, and we need to make sure anytime something like that happens we need to step on that and make sure it goes away very quickly.""","WASHINGTON (CNN) -- On Friday, an apology was issued by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano for a previously released department assessment.

Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano says she offered her ""sincere apologies for any offense."" She met with American Legion National Commander David Rehbein at Homeland Security headquarters to discuss the matter further.

 ""The secretary started the meeting with an apology to me personally, to the American Legion and to the entire veterans community,"" Rehbein told reporters after the meeting. In a statement issued by the department, Napolitano said, ""We connected meaningfully about the important issues that have emerged over recent days, and I offered him my sincere apologies for any offense to our veterans caused by this report. ... I pledge that the department has fixed the internal process that allowed this document to be released before it was ready. ""

The report was an unclassified assessment sent to law enforcement agencies. It was titled ""Rightwing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment."" The mention of combat veterans surfaced on a conservative radio program earlier this month, and it drew the scorn of commentators and conservative members of Congress. Rep. John Carter, R -Texas, called on Napolitano to resign.

 Rehbein said Friday it is time to move forward. ""In the mind of the American Legion, I think her apology was sufficient,"" he said. ""The way the Vietnam veterans were treated once they came home, that's what drives the sensitivity to this, because those things start small and then grow from there, and we need to make sure anytime something like that happens we need to step on that and make sure it goes away very quickly.""

John Smith suggests that ordinary citizens may be enlisted for specific tasks or roles, potentially expanding the workforce and utilizing their unique skills.","John Smith says civilians could be recruited.

From January 2003 until 2006, Baran directed the International Security and Energy Programs at The Nixon Center. Zeyno Baran says the United States can learn much from Turkey's expertise on Afghanistan and Pakistan. (CNN) -- Turks greeted President Obama with huge excitement Monday. This was the first time a U.S. president visited Turkey at the start of his term, sending a clear signal that this administration recognizes the importance of Turkey and wants to engage with it from the start. His address in the Turkish parliament was one of the greatest speeches made by an American leader in such a setting: He not only showed his deep understanding of Turkey's many complex issues and identities, but also handled tough issues with great skill. He framed his talk just right by underlining Turkey's European identity as a secular democracy. That said, it is important to remember how good U.S.-Turkey relations were at the start of the Bush administration. President George W. Bush also considered Turkey an extremely valuable partner, but then came the Iraq war. The United States genuinely believed Turkey would be one of the most important allies going forward. Despite official channels and experts making clear the difficulties in allowing U.S. military to cross into Iraq via its lands, the administration chose to listen to those who sang music to its ears. As a result, they based a whole military strategy on the Turkish parliament voting yes and were shocked when they received a no. Bilateral relations then entered a downward spiral. With Obama's election, there is renewed excitement in Turkey. Like most of the people of Turkey, he opposed the Iraq war and considered Afghanistan the ""good war."" Going forward, as President Obama underscored in his speech, Turkey can play an important role in Afghanistan as a reliable NATO ally. The question is: How can Turkey best help? Turkey is one of the few -- possibly the only -- NATO member that has deep religious, cultural and historic knowledge of both Afghanistan and Pakistan. In fact, the Turkish government has brought together the presidents of Afghanistan and Pakistan much before the United States began approaching them together. Reading the tea leaves, one may conclude that the Obama administration wants to cooperate with Turkey in engaging with the Taliban in Pakistan and Afghanistan. This would be the wrong kind of cooperation. Although Turkey has channels to the Taliban and has means to facilitate the talks, there cannot be a morally acceptable deal reached with the Taliban, whose ultimate goal is to curb all individual freedoms and universal human rights, especially when it comes to women. No matter what the reasonable sounding arguments may be in favor of this strategy, pulling Turkey into any kind of engagement with the Taliban -- either as part of NATO or bilaterally -- would have much worse long-term consequences. Instead, the Obama administration needs to think of ""victory"" not only in the short term and from a purely anti-terrorism perspective, but also in consideration of the people who have lived and will continue to live in those lands. In other words, providing true safety, security, justice and development for Afghanistan and Pakistan -- not the kind of society the Taliban has been providing. Indeed, it is in providing the basic securities that Turkey can be a great partner. Turkey not only can and will continue to help provide safety and physical security, but also could further assist with the reconstruction projects, such as building hospitals, schools, sanitation facilities and investment projects that would have direct impact on the socioeconomic development of the Afghan and Pakistani societies. There are many Turkish companies that have undertaken successful construction projects in these fields since early 2002. There are also military and civilian trainers, nongovernment organizations and even volunteer teachers who work in some of the most dangerous regions.

599,"NEW YORK (CNN) -- John and Elizabeth Calvert enjoyed the good life on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina, friends said, but they were growing more and more suspicious of the way their business books were being handled. Things weren't adding up. Money appeared to be missing. John and Elizabeth Calvert are featured on missing persons posters on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. So they scheduled a meeting with accountant Dennis Ray Gerwing to address their concerns, recalled one close friend, Nancy Cappelmann. The Calverts said they were meeting with Gerwing at his offices in the upscale resort community at 6 p.m. last March 3, she added. It would be the last time anyone would see or hear from the couple. The Calverts lived part-time on their yacht, docked at the island's Harbor Town Yacht Basin, the same marina where they managed boat slips. They spent the rest of the year in Savannah, Georgia, and also had a home in Atlanta. They were an active, affluent couple in their mid-40s, and their absence was quickly noticed. On the evening of March 3, 2008, the evening they were to meet with their accountant, both of the Calverts' phones were turned off. Family members said it was very unusual for either John or Elizabeth Calvert to shut off their cell phones. Watch an update on the case » Family and friends called police and reported the Calverts missing on March 4, after they missed appointments and still couldn't be reached. ""I was supposed to meet John that night and he is never late, so when 20 minutes went by, I got worried and called his cell, but it went straight to voicemail, like it was turned off,"" Cappelmann said. She was a good friend of the couple's and worked at one of their harbor businesses. Police and search teams scoured the island. Divers and dogs searched the harbor and found nothing. The Calverts' small airplane was still at the island's airport and provided no clues. Their 2006 Mercedes Benz was found parked at a hotel in Palmetto Dunes, a gated community six miles from where the Calverts' yacht was docked. The Mercedes also contained no forensic clues. In reconstructing the Calverts' last days, investigators concluded that Gerwing was worth a deeper look. They now say they believe the 54-year-old accountant was the last person to see the Calverts alive. Gerwing ran the management company that kept the books on the Calverts' four businesses on Hilton Head Island. Authorities were already looking into possible financial improprieties involving the company, The Club Group. They named Gerwing as a person of interest in the case about a week after the couple disappeared. An internal audit later revealed that Gerwing had embezzled $2.1 million from the Calverts and others, police said. Gerwing committed suicide within hours of learning he was a person of interest, slashing his neck and legs with a steak knife, authorities said. He also left behind suicide notes with vague references to the Calvert case, said Beaufort County Sheriff P.J. Tanner. Tanner said the notes indicated some acknowledgement of responsibility for his actions, but didn't say specifically what those actions might have been. Police also gathered circumstantial evidence that seemed to point to Gerwing, including drop cloths large enough to use to wrap bodies and latex gloves purchased on the day the Calverts disappeared. In addition, police learned that Gerwing's cell phone had been turned off for 12 hours after he was scheduled to meet with the Calverts. If Gerwing were alive, Tanner said, police wouldn't have enough corroborating evidence to name him a suspect and arrest him. Police executed search warrants on Gerwing's office, home and vehicles and found soil in Gerwing's kitchen. Investigators hope analysis of the dirt might provide clues to the origin of the dirt and a new location to continue searching for John and Elizabeth Calvert.
